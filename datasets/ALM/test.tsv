4	"Help! help!" exclaimed the young ladies, but there was no danger, for they quickly extinguished the fire.
2	I am the happiest of all creatures."
1	The guest heard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he could.
1	Chippy Hackee went home in a hurry!
0	"Everything in it is so stupid."
3	The corpse lay in a bedroom, near to the one in which we sat, and the old man was in great distress and weeping like a child.
2	She was glad that in her ugliness she had frightened the fowls.
2	Thereupon the King was full of great joy, but he kept the Queen hidden in a chamber until the Sunday, when the baby was to be christened.
4	He looked around on every side and exclaimed, "Oh, heavens, where am I?"
1	Fear and trembling came upon him as he thought of his mother; she had sent him out the day before to get some money, he had not done so, and now he was hungry and thirsty.
0	"Go your way," replied the old man in a surly voice, "I will have nothing to do with runagates; seek for yourself a shelter elsewhere."
4	"There goes one!" cried he.
2	"When everything is eaten up one has some peace," said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return home till night.
1	I wish I had never come!
3	They loved each other dearly, but sorrowed much that they had no children.
3	Timmy coughed and groaned, because his ribs hurted him.
0	If I were a cock, I should despise her."
2	She took the little girl in her arms, and they both flew upwards in brightness and joy far above the earth, where there was neither cold nor hunger nor pain, for they were with God.
0	"I am not in the habit of letting lodgings; this is an intrusion!" said Mrs. Tittlemouse.
2	"Yes," said the other, "mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand into his pocket without finding money in it--but where did you get that beautiful goose?"
0	"Get out, you nasty old toad!" shrieked Babbitty Bumble.
2	As he grew higher and still higher, with increased strength, his topmost boughs became broader and fuller; and in proportion to his growth, so was his self-satisfaction increased, and with it arose a joyous longing to grow higher and higher, to reach even to the warm, bright sun itself.
2	"Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to oneself," said she, and was quite satisfied with her day"s work.
1	Then the miser said, "Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity"s sake."
3	The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of black pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing.
2	She touched it with her finger, and said: "Ah! how good fowls are!
2	Now he was rich, had fine clothes, and many friends, who all declared he was a fine fellow and a real gentleman, and all this gratified him exceedingly.
2	Then a light broke in on her mind, and her heart expanded.
0	Then they all got excited; they hit out with their wings, pecked with their beaks, and flop! one after another was thrown out of the nest.
3	So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began to grow unhappy.
2	"I will take her," said the butterfly; and he made her an offer.
2	And Tiny did all the field-mouse asked her, and found herself very comfortable.
0	Hot iron and cold iron alike take the skin from our lips, and we feel the same sensation if we kiss either; and Anthony's kiss was now the kiss of hatred, as it had once been the kiss of love.
2	The little bird hopped round it and sang, "How beautifully soft the grass is, and what a lovely little flower with its golden heart and silver dress is growing here."
0	So she cried out, "The king"s daughter shall, in her fifteenth year, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead."
2	"Ah!" said the father, "what fears we have had for you!"
3	I asked him where he had left my brother, and how he had come by this stag, out of whose great eyes I saw tears flowing.
2	The wedding was celebrated, and after the king"s death, Dummling inherited his kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife.
3	But the king was not to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking another wife.
3	So the duckling sat in a corner, feeling very low spirited, till the sunshine and the fresh air came into the room through the open door, and then he began to feel such a great longing for a swim on the water, that he could not help telling the hen.
4	But when she began her song, and it reached Roland"s ears, he sprang up and cried: "I know the voice, that is the true bride, I will have no other!"
2	Joy was in every face and every heart.
2	Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child.
4	"Good Heaven! what's the matter with you?" asked his mother.
3	The poor lark was most unhappy as a prisoner in a cage.
2	Joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castle, the wedding was celebrated, and he was crowned king of the Golden Mountain.
1	But she, trembling in every limb, did not think of the adornment.
2	"The plates rattled with pleasure, and the carpet-broom brought some green parsley out of the dust-hole and crowned the saucepan, for he knew it would vex the others; and he thought, 'If I crown him to-day he will crown me to-morrow.'
1	Then the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to the shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks shook.
2	"Now life is beginning again," said the tree, rejoicing in the sunshine and fresh air.
2	"I've brought you some flowers; what a delicious smell of pie!"
3	When the faithful maiden heard of this, she grew so sad that she thought her heart would break, and she would not go thither, but the other girls came and took her.
2	Hans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, "You must be well off, master grinder! you seem so happy at your work."
2	How the sunshine cheers me, and how sweet and refreshing is the rain; my happiness overpowers me, no one in the world can feel happier than I am."
1	A fiery dragon could not have frightened the little boy so much as did the little dog in this place.
2	They lived quite retired and very happily; and as they had no children of their own, they had adopted a little common snail, which they brought up as their own child.
3	Now there was great sorrow, as the bird could only be allowed to play once a year; and even that was dangerous for the works inside it.
2	The cat was pleased with the thought, and joined the party.
4	"Ugh!" sighed the daisy, "that is terrible; now they are done for."
3	"Oh!" she said, "I have knocked off brother"s head," and then she wept and wept, and nothing would stop her.
3	Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my ease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress laid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky enough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon."
1	The princess heard him snorting and growling; she was terrified, and she cried, "Ah, the bear is behind us and wants to get thee!"
4	Then the tailor started; for suddenly, interrupting him, from the dresser at the other side of the kitchen came a number of little noises--
0	Tom Kitten bit and spit, and mewed and wriggled; and the rolling pin went roly-poly, roly; roly-poly, roly.
2	The roses nodded; they recognized their grey neighbours and were pleased to see them again.
3	At last came the little dwarf"s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it was so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!--so he sat down upon a stone and cried.
2	He knew very well that he had enough inside him to buy up all the other toys, and this gave him a very good opinion of his own value.
3	"We shall never have another singing-bird again amongst us; he was almost a Chinese," they whispered, and then they wept with such a noisy, clucking sound, that all the other fowls clucked too, but the ducks went about with redder eyes afterwards.
2	The thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when all the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the work that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to watch what the little elves would do.
2	I tore it open and read it; I cried and laughed at the same time, and was so happy!
3	Presently the fruit became round and firm, and she was glad and at peace; but when they were fully ripe she picked the berries and ate eagerly of them, and then she grew sad and ill.
2	The flower entwined itself even in his dreams- for him it bloomed, for him spread its perfume.
1	Then the fellow in the stove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out, crying: "That man knows everything!"
2	Mittens laughed so that she fell off the wall.
3	The poor child was very unhappy at the thought of saying farewell to the beautiful sun, and as the field-mouse had given her permission to stand at the door, she went to look at it once more.
1	Then those two rabbits lost their heads completely.
1	The manikin said: "That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very dangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill."
0	But the princes, peers, and great men mocked at him.
1	Then the youngest daughter said again, "I am sure all is not right--did not you hear that noise?
2	They leapt with delight, put out their heads, and cried to him: "We will remember you and repay you for saving us!"
3	He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he had seen and heard.
0	Mr. Tod had had an unsatisfactory night.
3	"He is too big," they all said, and the turkey cock, who had been born into the world with spurs, and fancied himself really an emperor, puffed himself out like a vessel in full sail, and flew at the duckling, and became quite red in the head with passion, so that the poor little thing did not know where to go, and was quite miserable because he was so ugly and laughed at by the whole farmyard.
1	"It is rather dark," said he; "they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in; a candle would be no bad thing."
2	"There's no place like home, even if it's a cellar."
3	She felt very low-spirited, because her count-child had shown no inclination to speak to her who loved him so well, and who had travelled so far to see him.
2	The countryman stopped to ask what was o"clock; this led to further chat; and Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and how all the world went gay and smiling with him.
3	How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?"
0	The cook once more said: "If you do not do it, it shall cost you your own life."
1	You can imagine how terrified the poor boy was!
0	He was further annoyed by the jay bird which followed him persistently.
4	And the wife struck; but she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.
1	The poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the cask, for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by the robbers.
3	When he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him, and left him alone on the wild rock, he said, "Alas! what roguery there is in the world!" and there he sat in great grief and fear, not knowing what to do.
2	Then the countryman rejoiced at his good luck, and said, "I like many things better than money: first, I will have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly, a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and thirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask."
4	"Heaven preserve us!" said he; "How did I get up here and fall asleep in this way?
0	Let her be expelled from the congregation and the Church.
0	But the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved, and how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that came to the door.
2	They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince"s kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great many years.
3	And then he sang his own melancholy song, and from that we have gathered this story, which they say is not true, though it's in print.
2	"I am truly glad to hear it!
2	His eyes brightened, and the words he uttered came with hesitation from his lips, but from the deepest recesses of his heart: "Christina, if you have not become too grand, and if you can be contented to live in my mother's house as my wife, we will be married some day.
3	"She sits upstairs in her room, Bewailing her sorrowful doom, Bewailing her trouble so sore, For old Mr Fox is no more."
3	The bitter tears fell upon the jasmine twig, and each day, as she became paler and paler, the sprig appeared to grow greener and fresher.
2	Amongst the visions which passed before my eyes, that was the most comforting in which a young man came and set me free, and when I opened my eyes to-day I saw thee, and beheld my dream fulfilled.
3	Indeed the poor bird had good reason to be sad, for it had been caught and put into a cage close by the open window.
3	Giuseppe went off at once, while his wife lamented, and the boy wept.
0	As for Farmer Potatoes, he has been driven nearly distracted.
3	He had little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily bread.
0	The second, "Who has been eating off my plate?"
3	Pigling Bland who was a sedate little pig, looked solemnly at his mother, a tear trickled down his cheek.
2	The brothers were not less delighted to see their little sister, but their joy was of short duration.
4	And his daughter was also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts; so she said to him, "Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses: one must be of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver, like the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this, I want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to which every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin."
4	Then Gretel gave her a push that drove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt.
2	At this the king was overwhelmed with joy, and made it known thoughout all his kingdom, that if his son would come back to his court he would forgive him.
2	And she rose up and drove them before her, till the bride saw them from her window, and was so pleased that she came forth and asked her if she would sell the brood.
1	When Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of dread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might be able to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas and lentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along.
2	Once again the wife stood under the juniper-tree, and it was so full of sweet scent that her heart leaped for joy, and she was so overcome with her happiness, that she fell on her knees.
2	However, he still felt very hungry, and the salad tasted very nice; so he ate on till he came to another kind of salad, and scarcely had he tasted it when he felt another change come over him, and soon saw that he was lucky enough to have found his old shape again.
0	Mr. Tod was coming up Bull Banks, and he was in the very worst of tempers.
0	"That shall not help you," cried she, "even if you have got a long way off, you shall still not escape me."
0	When madam awoke afterwards, there he stood before her with a little corn he had found, and laid it at her feet; but as she had not slept well, she was naturally in a bad temper.
0	First top off, then half-done, then--" "Will you hold your tongue," cried the cat, "one word more, and I will eat you too."
1	She seemed to be in a terrible fright.
1	However, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from the threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom should be bought up and burnt.
3	And now the sister wept over her poor bewitched brother, and the little roe wept also, and sat sorrowfully near to her.
2	His mother also told him how the chiming of that old bell had once filled her heart with joy and confidence, and that in the midst of the sweet tones her child had been given to her.
4	"Dead!" cried the laundress, turning pale as death.
4	"And here is one, and there is another!" they all exclaimed; for there were crosses on all the doors in every direction.
1	Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled.
0	"You speak without knowing the facts," replied the beetle; "don't you see that I am a prisoner?"
0	"Yes," answered the cat, "you will enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the window."
3	After waiting awhile, she went to Mother Holle and said, "I am so homesick, that I cannot stay with you any longer, for although I am so happy here, I must return to my own people."
3	He spoke to my father, and to a few neighbors who were there, of how lonely he should feel now she was gone, and how good and true she, his dead wife, had been during the number of years that they had passed through life together, and how they had become acquainted, and learnt to love each other.
0	"Everything is very stupid," the weather-cock said to himself.
2	"Good night, my masters!" said he, "I"m off! mind and look sharp after me the next time."
3	Her husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for her.
0	"No," said she, "I am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my leave.
2	Then she opened the door of the small house, and when she had opened it, there stood twelve horses, such horses, so bright and shining, that his heart rejoiced at the sight of them.
0	"I shall go distracted!" scolded Mrs. Tittlemouse.
3	Here, too, she found a shelter from storm and rain, but it was a miserable life, and bitterly did she weep when she remembered how happy she had been in heaven, and how the angels had played with her.
3	When the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping, he was grieved at heart, and said, "She has no doubt been here and driven away again, and it is now too late for me to save her."
1	In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought how to help himself out of his trouble.
2	In that solemn hour the sweet and joyous chiming filled the hearts of those in the humble dwelling with thankfulness and trust; and when, amidst these joyous sounds, a little son was born to them, the words of prayer and praise arose from their overflowing hearts, and their happiness seemed to ring out over town and country in the liquid tones of the church bells' chime.
2	Then the face of the dead one gleamed like the margin of the cloud in the moonlight.
2	With pious gratitude the girl looked upon this glorious work of God, and bent down over one of the branches, that she might examine the flower and inhale the sweet perfume.
4	"Why, Gretel?
1	But when she had reached the middle, and heard the water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still, and ventured no farther.
2	And when Lily came to the castle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him.
2	"Oh, what lovely flowers!
1	Suddenly there were fearful squeals; Alexander had squeezed inside the hoops of the pig trough and stuck.
3	But when we succeeded in bringing him home, and prevailed upon him to open the book with the dried-up plants in it, he would sometimes sit for a whole day looking at this or that plant, while frequently the tears rolled over his cheeks.
0	When she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to one of her servants, and said, "Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood, that I may never see her any more."
3	She sat down again, and stared mournfully at the grate.
1	She walked over the meadow, and presently she came upon a baker"s oven full of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, "Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago."
2	The maiden laughed, and said: "He does not stand much on ceremony, but I have already seen by his golden hair that he was no gardener"s boy," and then she went and kissed him.
2	"A lucky hit!" said he, as he called to his servant, and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was there, and bring him away one of the finest flowers.
2	So she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she thought: "The other must go down too, or else master will observe that something is missing."
2	The wolf thought to himself: "What a tender young creature! what a nice plump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman.
2	When they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great rejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, "One of you shall marry her, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be."
3	The father's heart was bowed down, but the mother sunk completely under the deep grief.
4	Away went the horse full gallop; and before Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his back by the road-side.
2	The street boys stood on tiptoe and shouted "hurrah," and whistled between their fingers; altogether it was a very splendid affair.
4	"Goodness me! where am I?" said he.
3	It was a grief as great to her as any grown person can experience.
2	Then up he got with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till he reached his mother"s house, and told her how very easy the road to good luck was.
3	Far in the interior of the wood, where a noisy swarm of laborers were working, stood Waldemar Daa and his three daughters, and all were laughing at the wild cries of the birds, excepting one, the youngest, Anna Dorothea, who felt grieved to the heart; and when they made preparations to fell a tree that was almost dead, and on whose naked branches the black stork had built her nest, she saw the poor little things stretching out their necks, and she begged for mercy for them, with the tears in her eyes.
3	He listened to them, and when he became aware of what they were saying, he grew very thoughtful and sad.
4	He still, however, slept on, and did not awake till he found himself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the cow"s rick, and the cow had taken Tom up in a mouthful of it.
3	All this was very sad for the poor little duckling.
4	Then she laid her head on the bird's breast, but she was alarmed immediately, for it seemed as if something inside the bird went "thump, thump."
2	There was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and when she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that, was quite happy and thought: "You certainly are a pretty girl!"
4	"Oh, indeed; and you will be like her some day," said he; and he flew away directly, for he felt quite shocked.
2	But she told them how happy she was, and stayed till the feast was over, and then went back to the wood.
3	"If he had but left me one, so that something remained for me to eat."
1	Oh, how frightened little Tiny felt when the cockchafer flew with her to the tree!
0	When it was ready and the soldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black manikin and said: "I have served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me, and left me to hunger, and now I want to take my revenge."
2	She looked so beautiful that he could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.
4	"Understand!
2	"Thus the small service done to the old man was richly rewarded!" said Meta Mogen.
2	Then it seemed as if new life was thrilling through every fibre of root and stem and leaf, rising even to the highest branches.
3	The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently began to cry.
2	The girl laughed, and nodded at the Snow Man, and then tripped away over the snow with her friend.
4	"Good heavens, how it crushes!" said the darning-needle.
0	If you are cold, come and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves."
2	He has wriggled out and run away; and he is dancing a jig on top of the cupboard!
0	What a nasty person!" said Peter.
3	But Tiny was not at all pleased; for she did not like the tiresome mole.
2	In each of them sat one of the Apostles in the midst of a great light, and she rejoiced in all the magnificence and splendour, and the little angels who always accompanied her rejoiced with her.
1	Then the miller was afraid, and made his paws white for him.
3	"I cannot bear it any longer," said the tin soldier; "I have wept tears of tin, it is so melancholy here.
3	Then the king, in his melancholy, wandered out to the spot in the wood.
0	"Stop!" cried the old goblin," is that the only house-keeping they can perform?
1	Peter heard noises worse than ever; his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!
2	Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her, and when she opened her eyes he said: "You are mine, and I am yours, and no one in the world can alter that."
2	Then she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly covered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome.
0	Have you the cheek to ask how I am getting on?
3	I kissed her hand, and wept bitter tears, and I wept still more when I went to my room, and threw myself on the bed.
4	Who would trouble themselves about such trifles? especially at a comedy, where every one is expected to be amused.
2	"Quite well, I thank you, and how do YOU do, my dear Ribby?" said Duchess.
2	Then the tears come into my eyes, and it is just as if my mother kissed me."
1	On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment.
0	And all those galleries one is expected to see, and the quantity of things you are obliged to run after!
3	"Alack, I am undone!" said the Tailor of Gloucester, and went sadly to bed.
2	His eyes were as clear and his face was as radiant as sunshine; and he held his mother in his arms, and she kissed his mouth, and wept as blissfully as any one can weep for joy; and he nodded at every old piece of furniture in the room, at the cupboard with the tea-cups, and at the flower-vase.
2	When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him, and cried aloud for joy.
2	Its joy was so great that it did not know what to think.
1	Peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises.
2	The books travelled all over the world, and some of them came into the hands of the emperor; and he sat in his golden chair, and, as he read, he nodded his approval every moment, for it pleased him to find such a beautiful description of his city, his palace, and his gardens.
0	"That was ill done, Hans.
3	But the girl did not care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband.
2	Then they came hopping up to it, satisfied their hunger, and cried: "We will remember you--one good turn deserves another!"
2	And the old grandfather nodded again; and the more he looked at Holger Danske, the more satisfied he felt that he had carved a good image of him.
0	But the buckwheat spread itself out with pride, and said, "Stupid tree; he is so old that grass grows out of his body."
0	Pigling Bland refused quite crossly.
4	"My word!
1	He declared, when he quite recovered himself, that this had been the most dreadful night he had ever passed; not for a hundred pounds would he go through such feelings again.
2	"Thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse!
2	"Oh," replied the old man, "I have pleasant thoughts of all that has passed, recalled by memory; and now you are come to visit me, and that is very pleasant."
1	The king gathered together his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer any opposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty army.
3	He was hungry and thirsty, yet no one gave him anything; and when it became dark, and they were about to close the gardens, the porter turned him out.
2	The little prince was at first quite frightened at the bird, who was like a giant, compared to such a delicate little creature as himself; but when he saw Tiny, he was delighted, and thought her the prettiest little maiden he had ever seen.
2	They looked at Little Claus ploughing with his five horses, and he was so proud that he smacked his whip, and said, "Gee-up, my five horses."
1	Oh, my poor son Thomas!" exclaimed Tabitha, wringing her paws.
0	So he went out and took the maiden aside, and said: "Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this knife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if you do not do it, you shall lose your life."
1	Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go.
2	The elder-tree smelt strongly, and the setting sun illuminated the faces of the two old people, so that they looked quite rosy; the youngest of the grandchildren danced round them, and cried merrily that there would be a feast in the evening, for they were to have hot potatoes; and the elder mother nodded in the tree and cried 'Hooray' with the others."
2	The fragrant leaves of the tree fell upon him and cooled his burning brow; upon his parched lips they seemed like refreshing bread and wine; and as they rested on his breast, a peaceful calm stole over him, and he felt inclined to sleep.
3	It feels sad.
2	In the garden grow roses; the mistress of the house is herself the finest rose petal, she beams with joy, the joy of good deeds: however, not done in the wide world, but in her heart, and what is preserved there is not forgotten.
0	"He's a bad kitten, Cousin Tabitha; he made a cat's cradle of my best bonnet last time I came to tea.
0	"You'll kill me with your crowing," she cried, "it's all your fault.
0	The sixth, "Who has been cutting with my knife?"
2	How rich I am!"
0	There they lay with their anger, holding their heads on one side and blinking the eye that was turned upwards.
2	The lazy girl was delighted at this, and thought to herself, "The gold will soon be mine."
2	Then the faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland, and grief came to an end and joy began.
2	What happiness for a mother!"
1	Then they were all terrified, and the King took the bird, the fisherman and the three children back with him to the castle, and ordered the prison to be opened and brought his wife out again.
2	They laughed and they wept; and Peter embraced the old Fire-drum.
1	"Bend your head as we do," cried the ears of corn; "the angel of the storm is coming; his wings spread from the sky above to the earth beneath.
3	The poor bird was lamenting its lost liberty, and beating its wings against the wires; and the little daisy could not speak or utter a consoling word, much as it would have liked to do so.
