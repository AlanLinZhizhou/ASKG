1	The thought occurred to him, however, that the king"s son might some day wish to be with his father, and thus bring him into great peril.
4	Duchess started!
3	With tearful eyes and mournful glances, the sorrowing daughters and the afflicted husband looked upon her who would not hear their words of comfort; and, indeed, what comforting words could they speak, when they were themselves so full of grief?
2	And she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.
1	But while Ribby had been hunting for the doctor--a curious thing had happened to Duchess, who had been left by herself, sitting before the fire, sighing and groaning and feeling very unhappy.
4	All the sparrows, and even a crow- and an old boy he was too- were startled at the sight; but still they flew after her to learn what kind of strange bird she was.
2	There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children.
2	They did not look ill at all now, but jumped about and were very merry, yet none of them noticed little Ida.
0	While this was passing, a duck came quacking up and cried out, "You thieving vagabonds, what business have you in my grounds?
2	"What a mercy that was not a pike!" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.
2	So he journeyed on, thinking of her all the way, and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road was made of, but went with his horse straight over it; and as he came to the gate it flew open, and the princess welcomed him with joy, and said he was her deliverer, and should now be her husband and lord of the kingdom.
3	But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her end drew near she called the king to her and said, "Promise me that you will never marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful as I am, and who has golden hair like mine."
2	Then they hung it in the cage of the little bird, who sang and twittered more merrily than ever.
3	"My sweet child, my golden treasure!" cried the mother, and she wept; but the Fire-drum sang, not out loud, but inwardly.
0	I am heartily tired of such neighbours."
1	Superstition made her alternately shudder with cold or burn with the heat of fever.
3	The tiny little creature woke very early in the morning, and began to cry bitterly when she found where she was, for she could see nothing but water on every side of the large green leaf, and no way of reaching the land.
3	Then when the king in his grief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died.
3	"How shall I be able to get there?" asked the man.
0	The miller thought to himself: "The wolf wants to deceive someone," and refused; but the wolf said: "If you will not do it, I will devour you."
2	The father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out, but they only saw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot, and when these had passed, there stood the little brother, and he took the father and little Marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced, and went inside together and sat down to their dinners and ate.
3	The black bow signifies mourning, the girl's face points to the same in a still higher degree; it is preserved in the heart and will never be forgotten.
3	"Tweet, tweet," sang the bird, as he flew out into the green woods, and Tiny felt very sad.
4	When Mr. McGregor returned about half an hour later he observed several things which perplexed him.
2	When the dance was over, the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well, that he thought he had never tasted any so good before.
3	This said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and every now and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to journey.
2	He was an old, old sailor, and she his old wife; they had already great-grandchildren, and were soon to celebrate their golden wedding, but they could not remember the date, and the elder-tree mother was sitting in the tree and looked as pleased as this one here.
4	What's that?
2	"With all my heart," said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together.
0	"Skins, skins!" they cried, mocking him; "yes, we'll mark your skin for you, till it is black and blue."
2	And the little creature danced and floated in the air, rejoicing in her delicate wings of gauze and velvet, rejoicing in the balmy breezes, laden with the fragrance of clover-fields and wild roses, elder-blossoms and honeysuckle, from the garden hedges, wild thyme, primroses, and mint, and the scent of all these was so strong that the perfume almost intoxicated the little fly.
3	They told him that their father was very ill, and that they were afraid nothing could save him.
3	As the axe cut through the stem, and divided the pith, the tree fell with a groan to the earth, conscious of pain and faintness, and forgetting all its anticipations of happiness, in sorrow at leaving its home in the forest.
3	"Croak, croak, croak," was all her son could say for himself; so the toad took up the elegant little bed, and swam away with it, leaving Tiny all alone on the green leaf, where she sat and wept.
4	"Good heavens!" she exclaimed.
1	The cook was frightened when he heard the order, and said to Cat-skin, "You must have let a hair fall into the soup; if it be so, you will have a good beating."
0	The third, "Who has been picking my bread?"
2	That was a pleasure!
3	And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of tears.
2	"We are pleased to hear that," said the two weavers, and described to him the colours and explained the curious pattern.
2	And young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple, came at once on the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf, with the sugarloaf hat, and a new scarlet cloak.
2	"I know where it blooms," said a happy mother, who came with her lovely child to the bedside of the queen.
2	"You must know that as soon as the king and all the court are gone into the town, the flowers run out of the garden into the castle, and you should see how merry they are.
2	Then they squeaked with joy!
2	So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large stitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these, and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked them together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then reached the ship and got home safe.
2	For a moment the little ones stood silent with astonishment, and then they shouted for joy, till the room rang, and they danced merrily round the tree, while one present after another was taken from it.
3	Hereupon he was much troubled, and asked the old fisherman if that was true?
4	"Oh, ho!" said the spring, "then I will begin to flow," and began to flow violently.
3	Now this king and queen had plenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of good things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but though they had been married many years they had no children, and this grieved them very much indeed.
2	Then they rose up and opened their drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and dressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager to begin dancing.
3	"The old woman has destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at once, and took their lives.
0	Don't stand there, looking so stupid."
2	Then the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox, and there was much rejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing still.
3	All the people grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away, leaving him alone by the sea.
2	How fortunate I am; it makes me so happy, it is such a pleasant thing to know that something can be made of me.
2	And then the prince and Briar Rose were married, and the wedding feast was given; and they lived happily together all their lives long.
2	The foxy gentleman admired them immensely.
2	Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she thought: "He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does"; and she said yes, and laid her hand in his.
3	Then she began to cry, and knew not what to do.
2	Then he looked at the picture he had bought at the broker's, and his eyes sparkled brightly as he nodded at it, and said, "Ah, she could sing that tune."
3	The poor girl remained there a long time, but at length, as he did not return at all, she was sad, and changed herself into a flower, and thought: "Someone will surely come this way, and trample me down."
1	The soldier saw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them; but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest princess, and she cried out to her sisters, "All is not right; someone took hold of my gown."
4	Then Sophy raised himself, and looked round quite astonished, "There must be a ball here to-night," said Sophy.
1	The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: "That is the first thief," and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said to his comrade outside: "The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he said I was the first."
2	The princess came out of the copper castle, and became queen, which was very pleasing to her.
4	Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap-where Lucie had yellow curls-that little person had PRICKLES!
1	Scream as he might, it would not help him.
3	Then he flew down with her from the tree, and placed her on a daisy, and she wept at the thought that she was so ugly that even the cockchafers would have nothing to say to her.
0	When the king saw him he fell into a passion, and ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon.
4	The servants now came in to look after the dead emperor; when, lo! there he stood, and, to their astonishment, said, "Good morning."
1	The little sister, however, was dreadfully frightened when she saw that her fawn was hurt.
0	"Eh!" thought he, "what a stupid blockhead I am!
0	I have nerves of my own, but I do not cry 'tweet.'"
2	The little mice only laughed, and tried another tune--
4	He found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than it really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense giant who stood in front of it.
1	Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of water into the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said that if I would promise not to tell anyone, and she said that early tomorrow morning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle full of water, throw you into it and boil you; but we will get up quickly, dress ourselves, and go away together."
2	"Oh, yes," said the man; "if I can have that, too, I should like it very much."
2	Full of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him the promised reward.
3	The tears of her husband fell on her forehead, but she took no notice of him; her thoughts were with her dead child; her whole existence seemed wrapped up in the remembrances of the little one and of every innocent word it had uttered.
2	I am very glad we have such good houses, and that the little one has one of his own.
1	Then she threw herself upon Heaven for help in her need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till at last she came to a large wood.
1	Then the woman clapped her hands, which frightened him still more.
2	"No care and no sorrow, A fig for the morrow!
2	"My golden treasure, my riches, my sunshine!" said the mother; and she kissed the shining locks, and it sounded like music and song in the room of the drummer; and there was joy, and life, and movement.
4	"Is he dead?" she exclaimed.
3	She had not a button- that she knew right well, and therefore she remained standing sorrowfully outside, till all the others had seen the grave and had gone away; then she sat down, held her little brown hands before her eyes, and burst into tears; this girl alone had not seen Puggie's grave.
1	The rabbit babies in the oven woke up trembling; perhaps it was fortunate they were shut up inside.
2	"Why this is beautiful, too beautiful to be believed," said the oak in a joyful tone.
2	Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in perfect happiness.
1	The rabbits shivered in their shoes.
0	"What wicked tricks are these?" said he.
3	Alas! you only remind me of what I have lost."
1	The pastor's hand trembled; he dared not stretch it out, he did not venture to pull a hair out of the sinner's head.
2	He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and contented.
2	She dropped Pigling's hand and commenced to dance, singing-- presently.
3	Every morning he flew to the window of the poor girl, and always found her weeping by the flower pot.
2	The whole winter the swallow remained underground, and Tiny nursed him with care and love.
1	But the sausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird flew out to meet him.
1	Then on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said: "Scour the whole forest through, and do not give up until you have found all three."
2	And then he talked of his wedding-day; and his eyes brightened, and he seemed to be carried back, by his words, to that joyful time.
2	"Yes, if I only knew a fresh one," said the old man, and nodded smilingly.
0	He's angry to-day.
2	"Certainly," said the beetle, "I shall be most happy; I have been exposed to the rain, and have had to lie upon linen, and cleanliness is a thing that greatly exhausts me; I have also pains in one of my wings from standing in the draught under a piece of broken crockery.
4	In the morning after he had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his great wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table.
2	The eight little pigs had very fine appetites--"Yus, yus, yus! they eat and indeed they DO eat!" said Aunt Pettitoes, looking at her family with pride.
0	"It must be a kind of garden plant," said another; and so they sneered and despised the plant as a thing from a garden.
4	I declare you have put on your Sunday clothes!"
4	"Ugh," cried the paper, as it burst into a bright flame; "ugh."
3	At last he could bear it no longer; so he took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.
3	And thus eight years had passed over their heads, when the king thought of his father; and he began to long to see him once again.
3	Oh, what bitter tears she shed! and she could not open her heart to any one for relief.
4	And when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar.
4	"Top off!" cried the mouse, "that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in your family?"
3	Many a time did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go, but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.
3	Then said the boy: "What a clever Elsie we have!" and sat down by her, and likewise began to howl loudly.
1	How the fir-tree trembled!
0	His grandmother scolded him.
0	They buzzed round the prince and stung his face and hands; angrily he drew his sword and brandished it, but he only touched the air and did not hit the gnats.
2	Its parents kissed it lovingly, and the father wrote these words in the Bible, "On the tenth of November, 1759, God sent us a son."
2	And all the good people they danced and they sung, And feasted and frolick"d I can"t tell how long.
4	"Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of good things, and robbers sitting round it making merry."
