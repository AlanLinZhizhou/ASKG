0	"Justice must still be carried out, even when one has relations and good friends among the prize committee; but that the snail should have received the second prize, I consider almost an insult to myself" "No," said the fence-rail, who had been a witness at the distribution of prizes; "there should be some consideration for industry and perseverance.
3	And so it was with Anthony; often the scalding tears, like pearly drops, would fall from his eyes to the coverlet and roll on the floor with a sound as if one of his heartstrings had broken.
0	Then they laughed and said, "Indeed, stupid Hans, where wilt thou get a horse?"
0	It must be done, for very shame; you are sure to be asked when you come back if you have seen everything, and will most likely be told that you've omitted to see what was best worth seeing of all.
2	"I do feel so happy," said the father, "and how beautifully the sun shines; I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again."
4	What do you mean by that?"
2	Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and went into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then.
0	"Humph!
0	The rabbits could not bear him; they could smell him half a mile off.
2	And his father said, "Heaven be praised! we have found our dear child again"; and he told his wife not to use the scythe for fear she should hurt him.
0	Listen to the story of Jemima Puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs.
3	And as she told him she wept.
2	And now the old king gathered together his court, and asked all his kingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess.
1	The cook, however, thought to himself: "If the child has the power of wishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble."
1	Tom Kitten wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted.
2	But Red-Cap went joyously home, and no one ever did anything to harm her again.
4	Anna Maria was about to argue the point when all at once there began to be other sounds up above--the rasping noise of a saw, and the noise of a little dog, scratching and yelping!
1	Mrs. Tabitha became more and more distracted and mewed dreadfully.
0	"What a buzzing and a rumbling there is in the elfin hill," said one of the lizards; "I have not been able to close my eyes for two nights on account of the noise; I might just as well have had the toothache, for that always keeps me awake."
2	She ran down, set a jug, said: "God bless it for you, Gretel," and took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should not be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught.
2	"Oh, what a splendour!"
3	The tailor replied: "Simpkin, we shall make our fortune, but I am worn to a ravelling.
2	They all joined in the chorus of praise, both great and small,- the good, happy child, and the poor field-flower, that once lay withered and cast away on a heap of rubbish in a narrow, dark street.
2	And they ran towards each other and took one another's hand, in the great cathedral of nature and poesy, and above them sounded the invisible holy bell; happy spirits surrounded them, singing hallelujahs and rejoicing.
0	Everything is so stupid!
3	Then he got up and clambered out of the cave, went into the forest, and thought, "Here I am quite alone and deserted, how shall I obtain a horse now?"
3	At length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her.
4	"But dost thou know what thou must promise?" said the King.
3	Then she took it, and went to her mother"s grave and planted it there; and cried so much that it was watered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree.
0	"That was ill done, Hans, you should have carried the bacon on your head."
2	"With all my heart," said Partlet, "let us go and make a holiday of it together."
0	Away with him out of the hall!"
4	"Ah, heavens," she said, "is it possible that my poor children whom he has swallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?"
2	His conscience was clear and his heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed, left all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep.
3	"Alack," said the tailor, "I have my twist; but no more strength--nor time--than will serve to make me one single buttonhole; for this is Christmas Day in the Morning!
2	Then she ran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress out which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in, looking like a king"s daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at seeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with her.
0	And the blood rose to the head of the excited criminal; he threw himself upon his comrade, and beat him with his clenced fist in the face.
0	Then at last he was angry, and cried quite impatiently, "I wish your neck was broken!"
0	But her mother said, "It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no clothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame": and off she went with her two daughters to the ball.
3	"Dear God, do help us," she cried.
2	Then he dismounted and took her in his arms; and she kissed him, and said, "Now you have indeed set me free, and tomorrow we will celebrate our marriage."
0	He did not like the student, and would grumble when he saw him cutting out droll or amusing pictures.
2	Give me a fine fat goose."
2	Yes, I shall get to Egypt, for I feel so happy!
1	So they went on, but the road led them out of the way; no house could be seen, it grew dark, and the children were afraid.
2	About midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the room, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they saw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed mightily delighted.
2	When the Queen rejoiced thereat, the Virgin Mary said, "Is thy heart not yet softened?
2	"Now I am in the house of God," she said, "and in that house we are happy."
3	The little sister wept and said, "Can you not be set free?"
3	Peter began to cry.
4	When Jemima alighted he quite jumped.
0	Hereupon the King was angry, and ordered him to be put in prison at once, because he thought he must have done some injury to the children.
4	"Good gracious!" he sighed, "I must have a tendency to softening of the brain, and here it is so exceedingly hot that the blood is rushing to my head."
4	The good man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening.
2	We loved each other so tenderly, and were so alike in our way of thinking and our inclinations, that we both embraced the resolution never to marry, but to stay together to the end of our lives.
3	In an instant they stood before him; but the queen wept, and said he had broken his word, and bad luck would follow.
1	Pig-wig looked anxious.
2	It trembled so with joy in all its branches, that one of the candles fell among the green leaves and burnt some of them.
0	Then the first looked round and said, "Who has been lying on my bed?"
1	Immediately a great fear fell on her.
2	So Master Thumb stayed at home with his father and mother, in peace; for though he had been so great a traveller, and had done and seen so many fine things, and was fond enough of telling the whole story, he always agreed that, after all, there"s no place like HOME!
3	She was sadder than ever as she drove along, and said mournfully, "I know he has fallen asleep, and will not be able to set me free."
0	"No," said he; "there is only a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; I am sure she cannot be the bride."
4	"Ho! ho!" said the old goblin, "is that what she means?
3	"She is sitting in her room, Moaning in her gloom, Weeping her little eyes quite red, Because old Mr Fox is dead."
2	When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed heartily; and the eldest said, "This fellow too might have done a wiser thing than lose his life in this way!"
0	Then there was no end to the rage and disappointment of Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca.
3	There she stood and cried, the swineherd scolded her, and the rain came down in torrents.
2	How sweetly they sing there; it is quite a pleasure to listen to them!
3	She had also to experience another grief in seeing Alfred marry again, marry Sophy, who was nothing at all to look at.
1	Driven by fear and horror, she flew homeward; she was almost sinking fainting to the earth, while the flock of pursuing birds increased, some even attempting to peck at her.
2	As the clerk thought of all these things, and became conscious of the great change in his own feelings, he smiled, and said to himself, "I must be asleep and dreaming; and yet, if so, how wonderful for a dream to be so natural and real, and to know at the same time too that it is but a dream.
0	"Trap, trap, trap! cackle, cackle, cackle!" scolded the disturbed cockerel.
3	Then said the maid: "What a clever Elsie we have!" and sat down beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune.
2	"I like that!" said the Princess.
3	Cold and pale lay the emperor in his royal bed; the whole court thought he was dead, and every one ran away to pay homage to his successor.
3	She felt dreadfully cold, for her clothes were torn, and she was herself so frail and delicate, that poor little Tiny was nearly frozen to death.
3	"Alas, thou canst not help me."
2	The young man felt the truth of the proverb, "Still waters run deep:" and his heart had sunk into their depths.
2	When the princess with her ladies passed by and heard the tune, she stopped and looked quite pleased, for she also could play it- in fact, it was the only tune she could play, and she played it with one finger.
0	"Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!" said she; "would that I had married King Grisly-beard!"
0	"Feet off the table-cloth!" said the old goblin.
0	"Thou child of perdition, I will yet carry out my purpose!" cried the Bishop of Borglum.
2	But presently they made it up again, and trotted away together, singing--
4	The duckling had never seen any like them before.
3	When a stone saw that, it took pity on the little cock, wished to help him, and laid itself over the water.
3	And the beautiful young lady fell upon her knees before him, and said, "O dearest huntsman! forgive me all the ill I have done you; my mother forced me to it, it was against my will, for I always loved you very much.
1	Tiny trembled very much; she was quite frightened, for the bird was large, a great deal larger than herself,- she was only an inch high.
3	"I know very well where she is," sighed the top; "she is in the swallow's nest, and has married the swallow."
1	The fisherman was half asleep, but the thought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed.
0	At last he went to the judge, and complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his back and a fiddle hung round his neck.
2	Can such happiness be imagined?"
3	"Sorry!" he exclaimed, and his voice was troubled with a grief as deep as my own.
3	It made little Tiny very sad to see it, she did so love the little birds; all the summer they had sung and twittered for her so beautifully.
2	The betrothed pair were very happy, and the mother was happy too.
4	Then the fox came, and said, "Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet."
3	As soon as they caught sight of her, they saw she was very pretty, and it made them very sorry to think that she must go and live with the ugly toads.
1	Presently the scream of an eagle sounded through the wood; it was an ugly cry, and it frightened the children; but before them, in the thickest part of the forest, grew the most beautiful blackberries, in wonderful quantities.
2	The emperor ordered them to be carried into the great hall where the princess was just playing "Visitors are coming" with her ladies-in-waiting; when she saw the large cases with the presents therein, she clapped her hands for joy.
4	Then the king put in a word, and said, "Each of you is right; and as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of you to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great deal better.
2	So the boy stayed with them, and the woman herself taught him to sew; and he ate well, and slept well, and became very merry.
3	Then he fetched other older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until at last they found it, but it was many thousand miles away.
1	As he now feared that the step-mother might not treat them well, and even do them some injury, he took them to a lonely castle which stood in the midst of a forest.
3	When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was greatly grieved, and said to himself, "I will remain here and wait for her," so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat and watched for a whole year, and every day he saw the king"s daughter driving round her castle, but still was unable to get nearer to her.
2	Now the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad to see him, and said, "Are you at last come to set me free?
1	There was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand, stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie.
3	The duckling remembered the lovely birds, and felt more strangely unhappy than ever.
0	The bear in great fury ran after the carriage.
2	Then he aimed a great blow, and struck the wolf on the head, and killed him on the spot! and when he was dead they cut open his body, and set Tommy free.
2	And Mr. Bouncer laughed and coughed, and shut his eyes because of the cabbage smoke ..........
0	The maiden looked for strawberries outside, but as she found none, she went angrily home.
0	And the eyes of all sparkled with malice.
0	I fell into a great rage at this, pulled out a pistol and discharged it at the monster; but the ball rebounded from his breast and went into my horse"s head.
1	My wife will be anxious!"
2	At length his longing was satisfied.
3	Anne Lisbeth went forth from the castle into the public road, feeling mournful and sad; he whom she had nursed day and night, and even now carried about in her dreams, had been cold and strange, and had not a word or thought respecting her.
3	The grand, majestic oak could not be quite happy in the midst of his enjoyment, while all the rest, both great and small, were not with him.
3	With silent steps, still sobbing, they left the room.
0	"There is no real pleasure in travelling," said mamma; "to tell the truth, it's very wearisome; I beg pardon for saying so.
3	Shivering with cold and hunger, she crept along; poor little child, she looked the picture of misery.
0	He spoke very excitedly, saying that their evil propensities would not be destroyed, nor would the fire be extinguished, and they should never find rest.
3	He saw a small wooden hut, made his way to it, and crept inside --"I am afraid it IS a hen house, but what can I do?" said Pigling Bland, wet and cold and quite tired out.
2	The ladies danced and clapped their hands for joy.
4	"Oh!" cried the devil, "what are you doing?"
2	He will be the joy of our home; and we old folks have nothing else to live for.
0	His whiskers bristled and his coat collar stood on end with rage.
2	When the king returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and wished him joy of his victory.
4	Then the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the blood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him.
2	The coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what the robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected to eat again for a month.
2	Here she slept at night, but during the day she amused herself on a table, where the woman had placed a plateful of water.
4	The young family were alive; shut up in the oven!
2	So they said, "Well, we cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and, little as he is, we will love him dearly."
0	He was in disgrace; Flopsy wrung her ears, and slapped him.
3	Then he would cry, but what nobody knows nobody cares for; so he would cry till he was tired, and then fall asleep; and while we are asleep we can feel neither hunger nor thirst.
3	Oh, how wretched I am!"
2	"We make it lively about the house," said the sparrow-mother; "and people say that a swallows' nest brings luck; so they are glad of us.
2	He sat and smiled, and the water dripped off his coat tails.
3	It certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right time!"
3	"You are right," said the emperor, and began to cry like a little child.
3	Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them to let him take her away; but they said, "We will not part with her for all the gold in the world."
2	And then the tree related the whole story; he could remember every single word, and the little mice was so delighted with it, that they were ready to jump to the top of the tree.
2	He now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble, because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him; for the great swans swam round the new-comer, and stroked his neck with their beaks, as a welcome.
3	The old grandfather wiped his eyes, for he had known King Frederick, with his silvery locks and his honest blue eyes, and had lived for him, and he folded his hands and remained for some time silent.
4	But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor!
2	Ribby and Duchess said good-bye affectionately, and Duchess started home.
2	Then she rejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more, and set out with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her, for they had thought her dead long since.
0	He now flew into a very great passion, and, suspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look after them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again would take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no reckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.
2	Then the old man came back with a pleasant face; and brought with him beautiful preserved fruits, as well as apples and nuts; and the little boy thought no more of the tin soldier.
3	One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying--oh, she did cry so!
1	Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands.
2	The long and beautiful day had been so full of joy and sweet delights, that when the sun sank low it felt tired of all its happiness and enjoyment.
4	As soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and they sat themselves upon the shoemaker"s bench, took up all the work that was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching and rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all wonder, and could not take his eyes off them.
0	Then the Princess would say, "He is of no use!
4	So she ordered the servant to bring the seventh horse, and when the miller saw it, he said that such a horse as that had never yet entered his yard.
2	What rejoicing there was!
3	She found him sleeping heavily, and all her efforts to awaken him were of no avail.
0	Then the two were so angry at this that they grew green and yellow.
2	And the Queen, when she had received the letter and read it, did as was written in it, and had a splendid wedding-feast prepared, and the King"s daughter was married to the luck-child, and as the youth was handsome and agreeable she lived with him in joy and contentment.
2	He seemed a merry fellow.
2	As he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf met him, and asked him what made him so merry.
1	But just at that moment somebody knocked at the front door, and Moppet jumped into the flour barrel in a fright.
3	Oh, my poor child," and she burst into tears.
2	But she only said this to frighten Jack the Dullard; and the clerks gave a great crow of delight, and each one spurted a blot out of his pen on to the floor.
2	They came to the river, they came to the bridge--they crossed it hand in hand--then over the hills and far away she danced with Pigling Bland!
4	And then all of a sudden--Miss Moppet jumps upon the Mouse!
0	Then the King grew angry, and ordered his wife to be cast into prison, and therein was she shut up for many long years.
2	At the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot the dwarf, and what she had said.
4	The King said, "Ah, heavens! what is this?
0	"What does that matter," said the cat, "it is no worse than Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called."
2	He looked very jovial, did little work, and had the more holidays.
2	She has a hymn-book with large silver clasps, in which she often reads; and in the book, between the leaves, lies a rose, quite flat and dry; it is not so pretty as the roses which are standing in the glass, and yet she smiles at it most pleasantly, and tears even come into her eyes.
1	The rabbits crept up carefully, listening and peeping.
1	While Tom Kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic, he wriggled about and tried to mew for help.
3	During the whole week she was sad and wept many bitter tears, but when Sunday came again she said: "Now I have suffered and striven enough.
3	They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the best of things and to remain with one another.
2	The first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself to please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in return.
2	Now the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire household should eat with him next day, and made a great feast.
4	The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.
0	At last the prince had his own statue erected on the public places and fixed on the royal palaces; nay, he even wished it to be placed in the churches, on the altars, but in this the priests opposed him, saying: "Prince, you are mighty indeed, but God's power is much greater than yours; we dare not obey your orders."
3	Alfred wept, and mamma wept, and they both wore mourning.
0	I got tired at last of those endless Madonnas; I began to think I was turning into a Madonna myself."
1	"I would rather you let that alone," said the man, "for I do not willingly give myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to satisfy your hunger."
1	It was the first hour of her awakening, full of anguish and horror.
2	The nightingale sang so sweetly that the tears came into the emperor's eyes, and then rolled down his cheeks, as her song became still more touching and went to every one's heart.
1	There was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as she was grown up, he was anxious that she should be well married and provided for.
1	He thought to himself, "If the giant sees me going in, my life will not be worth much."
4	The tailor, who had watched the fight with astonishment, was still standing there motionless, when the stag in full career bounded up to him, and before he could escape, caught him up on his great horns.
0	This vexes me more than anything.
2	She laid good eggs, and her mistress loved her as if she had been her own child.
0	When he was outside the house, he scratched up the earth with fury.
0	At last he said: "Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of?
0	Hans went into the parlour, but the miller said he should not sit down to table, for he was so ragged and torn, that they would all be ashamed of him if any one came in.
0	Then he carried the child away to a secret place, where a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the king and accused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by the wild beasts.
2	Then the queen took pity on the little fish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away it lifted its head out of the water and said, "I know what your wish is, and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will soon have a daughter."
3	"And I, poor fellow," said the drover, "I who am so old already, cannot get there."
2	But I am fragrant with perfume, for close to my gates most lovely roses bloom."
0	But inside the church the pastor stood in the pulpit, and spoke very loudly and angrily.
4	As I could not conceive from whence it came, I wanted to summon my waiting-maid who slept in the next room, but to my astonishment I found that speech was taken away from me by an unknown force.
1	So the huntsmen took it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened, and said, "I am a poor child that has neither father nor mother left; have pity on me and take me with you."
0	Jemima complained of the superfluous hen.
0	"No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you." said the countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the matter short by ordering him off to the gallows.
0	"You sit at home," said the cat, "in your dark-grey fur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that"s because you do not go out in the daytime."
3	Meantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the twelve years drew near the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became very sad and thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his face.
2	In the morning when he awoke, the three days had passed, and a coach came with six horses and they shone so bright that it was delightful to see them! and a servant brought a seventh as well, which was for the poor miller"s boy.
2	The paralysed girl sits in the warm sunshine and can see the wood and the lake; the world had become so large, so beautiful, and only through a single word from the kind mistress of the mansion.
3	Little Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of her bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the table and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing but weep.
2	"He is still alive," said the huntsman; "and I am glad that I had pity on him, but let him go in peace, and brought home his royal coat."
4	He was very much astonished, and called his wife and said to her, "Tell me, what can have happened?
4	"Heaven preserve us!" he thought, and opened his eyes wide, "I cannot see anything at all," but he did not say so.
2	"If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be able to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with it; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what can I wish for more?"
2	The old washerwoman put her head in at the door, and nodded to him quite kindly, and said, "Many thanks, you good child, for your help yesterday.
0	Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried: "You have invited a fine guest!"
1	At length she became uneasy, and wakened the boy, and asked: "Do you know where my husband is?
2	Then she saw that her deliverance was near, and her heart leapt with joy.
3	Then he was much troubled, and made known to the whole land that whosoever brought his daughters back again should have one of them to wife.
1	The bridegroom, who during this recital had grown deadly pale, up and tried to escape, but the guests seized him and held him fast.
2	The moment he had gone, Tommy Brock got up in a hurry; he rolled Mr. Tod's dressing-gown into a bundle, put it into the bed beneath the pail of water instead of himself, and left the room also-- grinning immensely.
1	They were still not safe; for he was such a great beast that in his fall he overset the boat, and they had to swim in the open sea upon a few planks.
0	Then the step-mother was still more enraged, and thought of nothing but how to do every possible injury to the man"s daughter, whose beauty, however, grew daily greater.
3	Then he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last he died too; and so all were dead.
0	"Mind your own affairs, busybody!" said the prince scornfully, and rode on.
1	But he soon found out where he really was; and was forced to have all his wits about him, that he might not get between the cow"s teeth, and so be crushed to death.
3	Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the boat, but before it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one side low in the water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost, and went home very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way, thinking that at any rate he had had his revenge.
1	She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who were lying close together, and every moment she was filled with renewed dread lest she should awaken them.
4	At last the rope gave way with such a sudden jerk that it nearly pulled his teeth out, and quite knocked him over backwards.
2	Benjamin was so excited that it was a mercy he did not awake Tommy Brock, whose snores continued solemnly in Mr. Tod's bed.
0	"That was ill done, Hans, you should have cast friendly eyes on her."
0	"My friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; I am affronted," said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.
3	Then poor Lily was led away, and forced to give up the golden dress; and when she saw that there was no help for her, she went out into a meadow, and sat herself down and wept.
0	Then he really did feel warm.
2	And they all rejoiced, and embraced him and kissed him without stopping.
1	At these words an icy shudder ran through the sparrow-mother.
1	Only tangled grass, and yet she was frightened at it.
2	At her side sits a young man, tall and strong; he gives her a rose and she smiles.
2	They embraced their dear mother, and jumped like a tailor at his wedding.
1	However, after a while he summoned up courage and went forward.
3	The king"s son was beside himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower.
2	And then Ashputtel took the dishes to her mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball.
0	Her Puggie had seated itself on the ground while she wrote, and growled; for the dog had come with her for amusement and for the sake of its health; and then the bare floor ought not to be offered to a visitor.
0	"There may be black snails, no doubt," said the old snail; "black snails without houses; but they are so vulgar and conceited too.
1	Great Claus got so frightened that he rushed out of the surgery, jumped into the cart, whipped up his horses, and drove home quickly.
3	"Alas! dear sir," said she, "yonder lies the granite rock where all the costly diamonds grow, and I want so much to go there, that whenever I think of it I cannot help being sorrowful, for who can reach it? only the birds and the flies--man cannot."
0	Then a vise was brought, and the bear put his claws in it, and the little tailor screwed it tight, and said, "Now wait until I come with the scissors," and he let the bear growl as he liked, and lay down in the corner on a bundle of straw, and fell asleep.
2	It touched the tin soldier so much to see her that he almost wept tin tears, but he kept them back.
2	How happy and delighted the little boy was; and after he returned home, and while days and weeks passed, a great deal of nodding took place from one house to the other, and then the little boy went to pay another visit.
2	"Look, mother," said the man, "at the beautiful bird that is singing so magnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a delicious scent of spice in the air!"
2	The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.
0	The devil jumped up, roared out, and would have treated her ill if she had not quieted him once more and said, "Who can help bad dreams?"
3	"They say that he was once an energetic young man, that he studied the dead languages, and sang and even composed many songs; then something had happened to him, and in consequence of this he gave himself up to drink, body and mind.
3	If he dried his eyes with his nightcap, then the tear and the picture would be crushed; but the source of the tears remained and welled up again in his heart.
0	Mr. Tod slapped his stick upon the earth and fumed; he guessed where Tommy Brock had gone to.
2	This was my destiny; it is quite a blessing.
2	"All went off well," answered the cat.
1	Then the mannikin screamed terribly, and cried, "Stop, stop, and let me go, and I will tell thee where the King"s daughters are."
3	The branches of the old willow-tree rustled in the wind, and large water-drops fell from his green leaves as if the old willow were weeping.
0	"The rats get upon my nerves, Cousin Ribby," said Tabitha.
2	So when Frederick and Catherine came down, there they found all their money safe and sound.
2	In her joy she hastily gathered her basket full, thanked the little men, shook hands with each of them, and ran home to take her step-mother what she had longed for so much.
3	They were telling one another of all the places where they had been waddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and one said in a pitiful tone: "Something lies heavy on my stomach; as I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen"s window."
1	And now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller"s wife was frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with her.
2	"Well," said the man, "now we will live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of our lives."
4	When the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put Tom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how to go, crying out, "Go on!" and "Stop!" as he wanted: and thus the horse went on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the wood.
0	I was soon very tired of it, although I had my children with me; and, besides, it's very expensive work travelling, very expensive.
2	He went inside, and said, "See, what a splendid bird that is; he has given me this beautiful gold chain, and looks so beautiful himself."
0	"Well, then, why do you lie in my way?" she retorted, "you must not be so touchy.
0	"Go out of my sight," said the emperor, for he was very angry; and both the princess and the swineherd were banished from the empire.
4	"Bless me!" cried the miller, and went there and found the wine.
0	Little Benjamin did not very much want to see his Aunt.
2	It became a splendid flower-garden to the sick boy, and his little treasure upon earth.
0	"Ah! wretch that I am!" sighed she; "why did I not marry King Grisly-beard?"
4	"All-gone," cried the mouse "that is the most suspicious name of all!
2	How pretty she was! and such a singer! not a theatre singer, nor a ballad singer; no, but a singer of the woods; for she wandered through the gay green forest, and had a concert there for her own amusement.
3	One day her mother said to her: "Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good.
3	The pieces were placed in a fire under the copper, and they quickly blazed up brightly, while the tree sighed so deeply that each sigh was like a pistol-shot.
4	Ribby stared with amazement-- "Did you ever see the like! so there really WAS a patty-pan?
0	"Now look at her arrogance," cried the step-sister, "to throw about gold in that way!" but she was secretly envious of it, and wanted to go into the forest also to seek strawberries.
2	"Oh," said Jack the Dullard, "I can hardly tell you.
0	The hen who had lost the loose little feather naturally did not recognise her own story, and being a respectable hen, said: "I despise those fowls; but there are more of that kind.
3	I suppose he is under the ground now; and Ida- alas! alas! it is not ended yet; miserable that I am!
4	"Look sharp!" said the king to the huntsmen, "and see what sort of game lies there."
2	Then the maiden looked at them and recognized her brothers, was glad and crept forth from beneath the bed.
2	"Well," said they, "you are come back, and we will not sell you again for all the riches in the world."
3	One morning the wood-cutter went out sorrowfully to his work in the forest, and while he was cutting wood, suddenly there stood before him a tall and beautiful woman with a crown of shining stars on her head, who said to him, "I am the Virgin Mary, mother of the child Jesus.
3	She wanted to cry out, but she could bring forth no sound.
3	"Nothing, nothing; only leave me to myself," he answered but the tears were running down his cheeks.
3	It makes me unhappy to think that I shall die, and leave this poor child," sighed she.
2	Then the child opened his eyes and looked into the glorious happy face of the angel, and at the same moment they found themselves in that heavenly home where all is happiness and joy.
2	"The sun is so warm, I quite enjoy it.
0	Then the miser grew angry, and said, "Oh, but I can"t make any use of you, you strike far too powerfully; what will you have for the one blow?"
2	But as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that he crept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in his face and laughed.
4	Well, one day some people came, who took hold of the flax, and pulled it up by the roots; this was painful; then it was laid in water as if they intended to drown it; and, after that, placed near a fire as if it were to be roasted; all this was very shocking.
3	A week has passed; this morning his death was in the newspaper, that is the reason of the girl's mourning!
2	Mr. Alfred again spoke of Italy, and of the glorious colors in Italian scenery; the purple hills, the deep blue of the Mediterranean, the azure of southern skies, whose brightness and glory could only be surpassed in the north by the deep-blue eyes of a maiden; and he said this with a peculiar intonation; but she who should have understood his meaning looked quite unconscious of it, which also was charming.
3	FAR down in the forest, where the warm sun and the fresh air made a sweet resting-place, grew a pretty little fir-tree; and yet it was not happy, it wished so much to be tall like its companions- the pines and firs which grew around it.
2	"'Pygmalion loved his Galatea,' was in the song they sung at my first wedding," said Alfred; "I once fell in love with a beautiful statue, which awoke to life in my arms; but the kindred soul, which is a gift from heaven, the angel who can feel and sympathize with and elevate us, I have not found and won till now.
1	She cried, "No, no I cannot bear it," and opened the other window, because drops of perspiration were running down her forehead.
1	"Oh!
3	They ran on a little farther, and then Christina fell down, and began to cry.
2	The little boy said not a word; he was half pleased and half afraid.
1	The guest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of his ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take them both with him.
1	Her terror too would not quit her, let her do what she might, and her heart beat continually and would not be still; the gold too stayed on her finger, and would not go away, let her rub it and wash it never so much.
3	At last a very little girl came out of one of the wretched-looking houses, and Ib asked her to tell him the way to the street he wanted; she looked up timidly at him, and began to cry bitterly.
0	And now as he was walking slowly through the sand, and the sun was burning hot at noon-day, he grew quite hot-tempered and angry.
3	Dark days and cold nights also passed over the old bell, and it noticed them not; but the bell in the man's heart felt it to be a gloomy time.
2	When the seven kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: "The wolf is dead!
2	"Wonderful weather this," cried one of them, "and so refreshing.
3	He bent his head mournfully, and sighed in deep sorrow, as an unquiet spirit might sigh.
4	It bewildered him as he thought of it.
2	They leapt nimbly upstairs and downstairs, and were merry and happy.
2	"What a wonderful quantity of plants," cried the beetle; "how good they will taste when they are decayed!
3	"Oh, my poor mother!" he cried, while the tears rolled down his cheeks.
2	The little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of grass; they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific.
2	We"ll laugh and be merry, Sing neigh down derry!"
2	"The word was so easy, the deed so small," she said, "the joy it afforded me was infinitely great and sweet!"
0	When the king saw the blood on her apron, he believed this, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built, in which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into it, and walled up.
2	"Oh how funny!" said Ida, and she laughed.
4	But--seated upon the stump, she was startled to find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper.
2	"There can be nothing better than we have here," said the father-snail; "I wish for nothing more."
4	Great quantities of fish could be seen through the clear water, sparkling in the sun's rays; they were quite surprised when they came so suddenly upon such an unexpected sight.
2	The little Flopsy Bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun.
3	And now there was no one at home but the daughter, and she mourned for her brothers so much that at last she also begged the fisherman to let her set forth, for she wished to go in search of her brothers.
0	"What! is he going to propose to me?" said the scissors, and she became so angry that she cut too sharply into the shirt collar, and it was obliged to be thrown by as useless.
4	He placed a pencil sketch on the table; and mamma, who had been over-powered with the appearance of the colored plates, threw a glance at the pale drawing and cried in astonishment, "What, did you see it throw up white fire?"
2	One glory eclipsed another; yet there was one picture that fixed itself on the little boy's memory, more especially because of the happy children it represented, for these the little boy had seen in daylight.
1	"Mercy!" cried Karen.
2	But they were very pleased with it, and wondered whether all the little sparrows could become nightingales.
2	He was sitting all over a small rocking chair, twiddling his thumbs and smiling, with his feet on the fender.
2	The old woman spoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter into her service.
0	"You are not kind at all," said Ida; "and yet they all danced with you."
2	"What a noble heart that good man has!" thought he.
0	"Fie on the villain that forsook her!"
3	Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife: "What is to become of us?
0	I don't want to sit here any longer."
0	He shut the door in Nutkin's face.
3	The boys only came the next morning; when they saw the dead bird, they began to cry bitterly, dug a nice grave for it, and adorned it with flowers.
1	"But," said Roland, "I counsel you first to take away her magic wand, or we cannot escape if she pursues us."
3	Ida and Anna Dorothea wept bitterly, Joanna stood, pale and proud, biting her lips till the blood came; but what could that avail?
2	"Here he is, master," said he, "I have got the better of him": and when the farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said.
0	"Ugh, you beast!" said the farm laborer who emptied the bucket, when he saw the toad.
2	"With the greatest pleasure," said the nightingale, and began to sing most delightfully.
1	"It is very unpleasant, I am afraid of the police," said Pickles.
0	He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his leg.
3	He and his sister, two years older than himself, had often wept scalding tears over the story of Him who suffered death on the cross for us all.
1	The willow-wren with his army also came flying through the air with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one was uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each other.
2	The others, however, went to the old fisherman, and all were glad that they had found each other again, but they hung the bird on the wall.
2	Now I shall be of some use in the world, as everyone ought to be; it is the only way to be happy.
2	The youth, full of joy, set out homewards, and took the Golden Apple to the king"s beautiful daughter, who had now no more excuses left to make.
2	He was a merry old man, always wandering about.
2	"Yes, father," answered he; "I have travelled all over the world, I think, in one way or other, since we parted; and now I am very glad to come home and get fresh air again."
4	While he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very clumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at last gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he lay a long while senseless.
2	Here I come!" shouted Jack the Dullard, and he sang till his voice echoed far and wide.
1	Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to Chanticleer, "Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I shall be choked."
3	How much came back to his remembrance as he looked through the tears once more on his native town!
1	The canary-bird fluttered in his cage, and the parrot flapped his wings and cried, "Let us be men;" the poor clerk, in the most deadly terror, flew through the window, over the houses, and through the streets, till at length he was obliged to seek a resting-place.
0	Then their brother, who was a little insignificant dwarf, went out to seek for his brothers: but when he had found them they only laughed at him, to think that he, who was so young and simple, should try to travel through the world, when they, who were so much wiser, had been unable to get on.
2	"Hurrah! it is quite famous."
2	So from this time forward Sultan had all that he could wish for.
2	And it gladdened his eyes, and to the flower he turned, even in death, when the Lord called him.
2	And she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the shoes and danced and jumped about in them.
2	And the old attendant nodded and looked very pleased, and then he carried the tin soldier into the house.
1	Then he sprang from the couch dreadfully frightened, ran to the well, filled a cup that was standing by him full of water, and hastened to get away in time.
3	There lay the old bachelor, forsaken by all, and unable to help himself.
0	But the mother said, "No, no! you slut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not go."
2	They stopped before the picture by Bronzino, in which Christ is represented as standing in the lower world, with the children smiling before Him, in the sweet expectation of entering heaven; and the poor boy smiled, too, for here was his heaven.
1	When he had made two snips, he saw the little Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying: "Ah, how frightened I have been!
1	But Benjamin was frightened--
2	"Oh, what a pretty bird!" said the miser; "I would give a great deal of money to have such a one."
0	But the ball, which wore a dress of morocco leather, and thought as much of herself as any other young lady, would not even condescend to reply.
2	"I should like to see him now, while I am so merry."
4	He could not conceive how this came to pass, for he never saw a human being in his house, and no one could have concealed himself in it.
3	Tears stood in his eyes, and glistened on his cheeks; he carried a great book and the binding was of velvet, with silver clasps.
3	Then Tiny wept, and said she would not marry the disagreeable mole.
2	Our honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before, he was now ten times more so.
0	Old Mr. Brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of Nutkin.
2	The sparrows assembled in dozens upon the wild vines, and chattered all together as loud as they could, but not about the old house; none of them could remember it, for many years had passed by, so many indeed, that the little boy was now a man, and a really good man too, and his parents were very proud of him.
0	Pickles nearly had a fit, he barked and he barked and made little rushes.
2	The mother gave them her blessing, and all the other beetles cried "hurrah."
3	At last they both lost themselves in the thicket; Christina began to cry, and then Ib cried too; and, after weeping and lamenting for some time, they stretched themselves down on the dry leaves and fell asleep.
2	Then he went to the king, and told him all his brothers" roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the princess given to him again; and after the king"s death he was heir to his kingdom.
3	The poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the wood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain.
3	Whilst he was sitting there, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the king"s principal servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how it was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she were alive still, or had perished.
2	She was very pleased with Tiny, so she said, "You are quite welcome to stay with me all the winter, if you like; but you must keep my rooms clean and neat, and tell me stories, for I shall like to hear them very much."
3	She had been cross, unkind, and really spiteful to him; but he was very sorry, and took the dead woman and laid her in his warm bed to see if he could bring her to life again.
1	Mittens ran away to the dairy and hid in an empty jar on the stone shelf where the milk pans stand.
0	"Away with him!"
0	The first said, "Who has been sitting on my stool?"
0	"Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!" sighed she; "would that I had married King Grisly-beard!"
2	She rejoiced much to see them again, and carried them all over the water, and then she too went away, for now she was freed.
3	Then the cock was so distressed that he cried aloud, and every animal came to lament the little hen, and six mice built a little carriage to carry her to her grave, and when the carriage was ready they harnessed themselves to it, and the cock drove.
2	But the lizards continued to run up and down the riven tree; and one said to the other, "Oh, how much I was pleased with the old goblin!"
2	The feast was grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you and I had been of the party.
2	The wolf is dead!" and danced for joy round about the well with their mother.
4	But she forgot about that hole in the duster; and when she untied it-- there was no Mouse!
2	So the woman was obliged to bring out the wine also, which she had hidden, and the farmer drank it till he became quite merry.
2	The little tailor did not let himself be frightened away, but was quite delighted, and said, "Boldly ventured is half won."
1	"A grave! dig me a grave!" still sounded in her ears; she was fearful that the cock might crow, and the first red streak appear in the east, before she had finished her work; and then she would be lost.
2	"O"er hill and o"er dale So happy I roam, Work light and live well, All the world is my home; Then who so blythe, so merry as I?"
0	"I"ll put a screw into that business," said the little tailor.
3	On the following Sunday they all went to church, and she was asked whether she wished to go too; but, with tears in her eyes, she looked sadly at her crutches.
2	The wedding-feast was held, and they lived happily together a long time.
2	How happy the daisy was!
0	So she took the doll out, who looked quite cross, and said not a single word, for she was angry at being turned out of her bed.
2	The tailor was looking at the beauty with beating heart, when she suddenly opened her eyes, and started up at the sight of him in joyful terror.
2	So he took the purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his bargain.
2	A little homely bed was prepared for him, but to him who had so often slept on the hard stones it was a royal couch, and he slept sweetly and dreamed of the splendid pictures and of the Metal Pig.
0	At this the son was vexed; and forgetting his word, turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son.
2	However, he passed a very pleasant time; went to the theatre, drove in the king's garden, and gave a great deal of money to the poor, which was very good of him; he remembered what it had been in olden times to be without a shilling.
1	I can't find my way home!"
2	The giant took the trunk on his shoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who could not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little tailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and whistled the song: "Three tailors rode forth from the gate," as if carrying the tree were child"s play.
0	Then he called to the miser, and said, "Tell us now, you vagabond, where you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only," "I stole it," said the miser in the presence of all the people; "I acknowledge that I stole it, and that you earned it fairly."
0	And the snail spat at them with contempt.
4	Jemima Puddle-duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of feathers.
4	When the courtiers heard this they were shocked, and said, "Heaven forbid that a father should marry his daughter!
1	Pigling Bland, much alarmed, determined to leave at daybreak.
2	"Well," said the shepherd, "if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your horse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it myself."
2	"Ah, that's lucky!" exclaimed Jack the Dullard, "for I suppose you'll let me roast my crow at the same time?"
2	It is overpowering, and yet it is delightful."
2	"How lighthearted I feel," said the father, "so pleased and cheerful."
4	It is quite shocking that one glass of punch should have upset me like this."
2	The pea-blossom pleased him most of all; she was white and red, graceful and slender, and belonged to those domestic maidens who have a pretty appearance, and can yet be useful in the kitchen.
2	And when she came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine, and as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she was cooking until she was satisfied, and said: "The cook must know what the food is like."
2	A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.
2	"Why, what should make me down-hearted?" said he; "I am sound in health and rich in purse, what should I care for?
3	Soon afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden; and the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always good and kind to all about her.
2	The son said: "Most gracious father, I will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower," and he thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table, and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.
1	"Oh; oh! they are coming back!"
2	The boy raised his hands towards the smiling children, and then the Pig ran off with him through the open vestibule.
3	Sorrow and suffering deprived Anthony's father of his strength, so that he had something else to think of besides nursing his love-sorrows and his anger against Molly.
2	"Oh," said the ass, "by all means go with us to the great city; you are a good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician."
2	May beetles hummed, the bees murmured, the birds sang, each in his own way; the air was filled with the sounds of song and gladness."
3	At first Ib said not a word, but he became as white as the wall, and shook his head gently, and then he spoke,- "Christina must not refuse this good fortune."
3	Song doth not carry them forth over the lands, nor into the hearts of men; therefore I have no rest and no peace."
2	"Safe return, and a wedding this day next year," he cried; and when the glasses were empty he took the bottle, raised it on high, and said, "Thou hast been present here on the happiest day of my life; thou shalt never be used by others!"
4	Ah! what a sight she saw there!
0	Mad with pain, he tore off the coverings and his clothes too, flinging them far away, and danced about before the eyes of his ferocious soldiers, who now mocked at him, the mad prince, who wished to make war with God, and was overcome by a single little gnat.
3	Then Gretel called out to her master: "If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away from the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten the moment they are at their juiciest."
1	This servant was equally alarmed, and he got out as fast as he could.
0	The seventh, "Who has been drinking my wine?"
3	He prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain.
0	"Go away, you bold bad spider!
0	Mrs. Tittle- mouse began to get cross.
2	"Bird," he said, "what a beautiful song that is you sing!
2	Hans took the stone, and went his way with a light heart: his eyes sparkled for joy, and he said to himself, "Surely I must have been born in a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of itself.
2	Then all three were delighted.
2	Hans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and then drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky one.
2	The rabbit was quite excited because he knew that he was to be taken up, and let down again in a parachute.
1	The boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him: "Oh, wild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten!"
2	There they found their child, now grown up to be comely and fair; and after all their troubles they lived happily together to the end of their days.
2	Her beautiful, noble child had been a dear angel, and possessed the kindest heart; he had loved her so much, and she had loved him in return; they had kissed and loved each other, and the boy had been her joy, her second life.
0	Then I would clench my fist, and cry, "We will kill these Turks!"
3	Her youngest child, looked for in the midst of prosperity, had sunk into the grave when only a few weeks old; and at last Christina herself became sick unto death, and lay, forsaken and dying, in a miserable room, amid poverty she might have borne in her younger days, but which was now more painful to her from the luxuries to which she had lately been accustomed.
0	After quarreling at supper, Flopsy and old Mr. Bouncer had passed a sleepless night, and quarrelled again at breakfast.
1	A little frightened voice called out "Who's that?"
4	The duck stared at it and exclaimed, "It is very large and not at all like the others.
0	The sight that met Mr. Tod's eyes in Mr. Tod's kitchen made Mr. Tod furious.
0	"Aha! are you there?" cried the soldier, "get to your work at once!
2	When the little girl heard this (for she stood behind the door all the time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant all the ravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each other, and went merrily home.
3	Then she was much grieved, and went to her father and mother, and asked if she had any brothers, and what had become of them.
2	And there she sat as proudly as if she were in a state coach, and looked all around her.
2	Old Mr. Bouncer coughed and laughed; and Tommy Brock puffed and grinned.
2	"How can you ask?" said Hans; "I should be the happiest man in the world, if I could have money whenever I put my hand in my pocket: what could I want more? there"s the goose."
3	"That"s a nice trick!" said her master, and lamented the fine chickens.
0	Then Tom Thumb lost his temper.
3	Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at length came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness.
2	Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven.
4	So he laid the stone carefully by his side on the bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a little, and down it rolled, plump into the stream.
3	"When God is so hard to me, how can I expect men to be better?" she said with groans and tears.
1	There was less smoke, but Tom Kitten felt quite lost.
1	"Will you come and help me hold it?" said the farmer, going towards the chest in which his wife had hidden the sexton, who now lay inside, very much frightened.
1	Then she became terrified, and turned back and repented right heartily of her sin.
3	"Ah, you poor child," answered the old woman, "what a place for you to come to!
1	"But we are very much frightened," said the young storks, and they drew back their heads into the nests.
3	The sisters mourned as young hearts can mourn, and were especially grieved at the sight of their parents' sorrow.
2	And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever was heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other.
3	Thus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully.
2	When the cloth was laid, the Lord sat down with the man and his wife, and he enjoyed their coarse food, for there were happy faces at the table.
4	But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head of her bed.
3	Here she sat down with her hymn-book, and as she was reading it with a pious mind, the wind carried the notes of the organ over to her from the church, and in tears she lifted up her face and said: "O God! help me!"
0	"I don't understand your outlandish talk," he cried at last, angrily turning his back upon them.
3	Aunt Pettitoes sighed and grunted, and addressed those little pigs as follows--
2	The doll, whose neck had been darned, was so excited that the place in her neck burst, and the money-pig declared he must do something for one of the players, as they had all pleased him so much.
1	In Mr. Tod's kitchen, amidst the wreckage, Benjamin Bunny picked his way to the oven nervously, through a thick cloud of dust.
1	Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went cautiously across the hearthrug.
1	"Nothing nothing," he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the man might not see it.
2	How wonderful it is, that after all I have suffered, I am made something of at last; I am the luckiest person in the world- so strong and fine; and how white, and what a length!
0	And to this day, if you meet Nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle, he will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout--
3	As she had sat by his little cot, so now she sat by his grave; and here she could weep freely, and her tears fell upon it.
1	He will strike you down before you can cry for mercy."
2	"I promise you I will not say it any more," said the other; but as soon as people came by, nodding to him, and wishing him "Good day," he became so pleased, and thought how grand it looked to have five horses ploughing in his field, that he cried out again, "Gee-up, all my horses!"
1	All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king"s son in golden clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was making sport of her.
2	Then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and capered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced out at the door, and away over the green.
2	I can trust you, for I believe that I do love you.
2	"Ah!" said the fisherman, "how happily we shall live now!"
2	The giant was pleased with the good cheer, and ate and drank to his heart"s content.
2	Benjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf.
2	He was quite dry himself and grinning; and he threw the cup of scalding tea all over Mr. Tod.
4	"That would be a fine thing!" cried the miller, and went there and found the salad.
1	"Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago," cried the loaves as before.
2	These are the jewels that rejoice a singer's heart.
0	"Away with him!"
2	And while she was speaking, the child plucked off quite a large apple, and ran to her sisters, saying, "Just taste, my dear little sisters, for never in my life have I tasted anything so delightful."
2	"It's a very fine morning!" said Mr. Drake Puddle-duck.
0	The fourth, "Who has been meddling with my spoon?"
2	This pleased the Lord, and he went in.
2	As he was hungry, and saw the food, he, too, place himself at the table, ate with those who were eating and enjoyed it.
2	So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the one chicken in great glee.
2	Certainly it was rather crooked, rather up and down, one leg thick, and another thin; still it was like the copy, and he was overjoyed at what he had done.
0	First he had been upset by breaking the plate.
3	So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they would bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just as it did while she was alive; so they said, "We will never bury her in the cold ground."
2	"Ah!" said the young man, "that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?"
1	And she went quickly up to the church-door; but when she came there, the red shoes were dancing before her, and she was frightened, and turned back.
2	He ran or flew after her, touched the cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when they walked together in the wood.
2	"Everything around me is so wonderfully bright and warm, and beautiful, that it makes me joyous."
1	Then the father started, trembling with fear and horror, and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but as no gold was come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a joke that the dwarf was playing him, and that, at any rate, when the money came, he should see the bearer, and would not take it in.
3	The youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he begged for a night"s lodging.
3	The poor swineherd took these words to heart, for they were addressed to him; he knew not that there were others who were equally ignorant.
0	You need not be in a hurry; you are always so impatient, and the youngster is getting just the same.
0	But the untidiness was something dreadful--"Never did I see such a mess--smears of honey; and moss, and thistledown--and marks of big and little dirty feet-- all over my nice clean house!"
1	Tom Kitten was getting very frightened!
4	"The chimney wants sweeping-- Oh, dear me, Cousin Ribby--now Moppet and Mittens are gone!
0	"That"s ill done, Hans, you should have put the knife in your pocket."
3	And the birds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snowdrop; and first of all came an owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side.
2	Then she went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time was come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with gladness.
0	Mrs. Tittlemouse looked at her severely.
0	The Grasshopper only sprang half as high, but he sprang straight into the King's face, and the King declared that was horribly rude.
3	The aged king ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the king"s own heart, and he soon died.
3	She folded her hands, and hid her face in the cotton curtains of the bed, and wept.
3	His sons were very much grieved at their father"s sickness; and as they were walking together very mournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and asked what was the matter.
3	Tiny looked after him, and the tears rose in her eyes.
2	"'That is quite true,' said the water-bucket; and he made a spring with joy, and splashed some water on the floor.
0	So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her, and told her she might go.
2	"I was so miserable," she said, "when I came out, but that has all passed away; that is indeed a splendid bird, and he has given me a pair of red shoes."
3	Tears of sorrow rolled down their cheeks, and fell in heavy drops on the floor, but not a word was spoken.
4	"Good heavens! listen to the voice of an innocent child," said the father, and one whispered to the other what the child had said.
2	The tailor drove quietly to church, and the princess was married to him at once, and he lived with her as happy as a woodlark.
3	His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted so much about his faithfulness that she nearly died.
3	The youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possible to perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and there he sat sorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be led to death.
3	She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she became conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she was homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with Mother Holle than with her mother and sister.
0	Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve his late companion some trick.
1	At this, too, the youngest sister was terribly frightened, but the eldest always silenced her.
3	The lieutenant felt this very keenly, and therefore leaned his head against the window-frame, and sighed deeply.
1	He was afraid to go to sleep himself; for the rest of the night he sat listening to the chirping of the crickets and to the snores of Mr. Piperson overhead.
0	The king ordered the man to be brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he could before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked upon as guilty and executed.
3	The son was in such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said: "Yes, dear father, your will shall be done," and thereupon the king shut his eyes, and died.
2	Chippy Hackee was not too fat, but he did not want to come; he stayed down below and chuckled.
3	Now when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Ashputtel went sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out:
1	Each wanted to be first at drawing the water, and so they were in such a hurry that all let their pitchers fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at one another, and did not know what to do, for none dared go home.
2	She lived three days more, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two white doves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of heaven, followed her body and seated themselves on her grave.
2	The King came down himself and opened the door, and there he found both strong and well, and rejoiced with them that now all sorrow was over.
0	"Lord have mercy on us!" cried the father; "is that all you have learnt?
2	The same thing was continued through many generations of Ephemera; all of them felt equally merry and equally happy.
0	"That is no business of mine," said the fiddler: "why should you wish for another husband?
2	How charming this is for a mother, is it not Mr. Beetle?" for she knew the stranger by his horny coat.
3	They walked the whole day over meadows, fields, and stony places; and when it rained the little sister said, "Heaven and our hearts are weeping together."
2	Then he took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path; while Hans went on the way homewards free from care.
3	So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but said it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent cause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and thought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back; and she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole away, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever they might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her.
0	Am not I good enough for you?"
2	Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they had beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden slipper.
3	"Ah!" replied the horse, "justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has forgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I can no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become stronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I have of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so."
0	"He is of no use!" said the Princess.
1	"I am dreadfully afraid it WILL be mouse!" said Duchess to herself--"I really couldn't, COULDN'T eat mouse pie.
1	Oh, my dear Ribby, I do feel so ill!"
2	Then he rustled his feathers, curved his slender neck, and cried joyfully, from the depths of his heart, "I never dreamed of such happiness as this, while I was an ugly duckling."
2	Then they got a flower-pot, filled it with earth, and were soon both very busy and eager about it.
4	"Oh, o- h!" cried the young storks.
0	"That was ill done, Hans, you should have led the calf, and put it in the stall."
3	A little while later she called her husband, and said to him, weeping.
2	The shoemaker's boy liked the idea of getting the four shillings, so he ran very fast and fetched the tinder-box, and gave it to the soldier.
2	"See," cried the youngest, "there is a new one;" and the rest were delighted, and ran to their father and mother, dancing and clapping their hands, and shouting joyously, "There is another swan come; a new one has arrived."
1	When the two heard that, they were frightened to death, and ran away in great haste.
3	So the man went away quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king.
2	The emperor was so delighted that he declared the nightingale should have his gold slipper to wear round her neck, but she declined the honor with thanks: she had been sufficiently rewarded already.
1	So the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along, "This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be tired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done."
2	"Yes, this is East Street; how beautifully bright and gay it looks!
2	Then they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round their father"s neck.
3	Oh, how she wept and prayed that she also might die!
3	When she awoke, and wanted to see her child, the husband, with tears, said, "We have closed the coffin; it was necessary to do so."
0	Now when she heard that they were so happy, and so well off, envy and hatred rose in her heart and left her no peace, and she thought of nothing but how she could bring them again to misfortune.
1	Peter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home.
2	"Well, this is quite wonderful; I could not have believed that I should be so favored by fortune.
2	The sun shone among the delicate leaves; everything breathed forth the loveliest fragrance, and all felt as we do when we are filled with joy at the thought of our happiness.
2	The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone.
1	When she heard the farmer coming she was frightened, and begged the sexton to hide himself in a large empty chest that stood in the room.
3	And he, poor boy, wept also, as he sat alone by the river, near to and watching the damp linen.
2	They lived together very happily, and the queen had a son.
2	But the king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and he thought in his heart, "I never saw any one half so beautiful."
2	Then Sophy was very happy, and said they might keep her bed; she did not mind lying in the drawer at all.
1	She was frightened, and wanted to throw the red shoes away; but they stuck fast.
2	"Summer cannot show a more beautiful sight," she exclaimed, while her eyes sparkled.
0	And they hacked away at him, and they pulled at him, and ate him up, because of the little bruise.
3	Here everything was bright, and the boy knelt down by the first tomb on his right, the grave of Michael Angelo, and sobbed as if his heart would break.
1	The next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old woman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and turned to run away.
3	Night fell, and nothing was left for him to do, but to seek a bed in this painful solitude.
1	They crept out of their tunnel, and hung about amongst the rocks and bushes, listening anxiously.
3	Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel: "Now all is over with us."
2	"'Could I but have my love, Who then so happy as Glove!
3	But when he got into the cellar, and they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and that Elsie"s child was the cause, and the Elsie might perhaps bring one into the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if he should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very time when it fell down, he cried: "Oh, what a clever Elsie!" and sat down, and likewise wept with them.
2	So a year passed, and the emperor, the court, and all the other Chinese knew every little turn in the artificial bird's song; and for that same reason it pleased them better.
2	"How beautiful this world is!" said the caterpillar.
0	But when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in birth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform another task.
0	All this was new and interesting; that is, for the first time, but afterwards, as the weather-cock found out, they repeated themselves and always told the same stories, and that's very tedious, and there was no one with whom one could associate, for one and all were stale and small-minded.
4	And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they came back again said, "In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful beast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand kinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep."
3	He sat for a while very sorrowfully, then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which was still half full.
4	"Good gracious!" he exclaimed; "what in the world has happened to the bishop? what can he be thinking about?"
3	Then you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.
4	He started back, quite bewildered with the fright which the goloshes of Fortune had caused him.
3	"Oh, now I have no horse at all, said Little Claus, weeping.
1	"Oh I do feel so ill ALL OVER me, my dear Ribby."
3	"If I die, bury me under the juniper-tree."
4	As soon as the man in the sack saw him passing under the tree, he cried out, "Good morning! good morning to thee, my friend!"
3	"It is not very pleasant, certainly; I should imagine it is something like being married; for here I am stuck fast."
3	Then she did as she was told; but when all was done she could not help crying, for she thought to herself, she should so have liked to have gone with them to the ball; and at last she begged her mother very hard to let her go.
0	But Simpkin hid a little parcel privately in the tea-pot, and spit and growled at the tailor; and if Simpkin had been able to talk, he would have asked: "Where is my MOUSE?"
0	Again and again he bawled it out, but as she did not stir he flew into a passion, and threw the glass of mead in her face; it struck her on the nose, and she fell backwards out of the cart, for she was only seated there, not tied in.
3	But Marleen stood looking on, and wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no need of salt.
1	"Mother," said the boy, "how dreadful you look!
4	He was astonished when he saw them come alone, and asked what had happened to them.
2	"Let me see him," said the young man, and then he smiled and shook his head, and said, "It can scarcely be the same, but it reminds me of something that happened to one of my tin soldiers when I was a little boy."
3	Then he could easily guess what had happened, and much grief reigned in the royal court.
2	A perfectly lovely little black Berkshire pig stood smiling beside him.
2	People are so kind; they seem really to think I do them a favour in letting them make me rich, and giving me good bargains."
4	"How COULD I have swallowed it! such a large thing as a patty-pan!"
1	At this sight the fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his knees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and said:
3	A record of this bright display will live in the memory of man, for through it the pupil in the military school was in tears and sorrow.
3	The evening came, and nobody appeared to bring the poor bird a drop of water; it opened its beautiful wings, and fluttered about in its anguish; a faint and mournful "Tweet, tweet," was all it could utter, then it bent its little head towards the flower, and its heart broke for want and longing.
1	But he did not venture to give him his dismissal, for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his people dead, and place himself on the royal throne.
0	He did all he could to soothe her, and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in truth, and was only thinking how she should punish him.
2	She rather fancied a tree stump amongst some tall foxgloves.
0	"Impertinent creature!" exclaimed the Portuguese duck: "would you compare me with the cat- that beast of prey?
0	"Nonsense!
3	Here he remained the whole night, feeling very tired and sorrowful.
0	Pigling Bland reproved Alexander.
2	Tiny pleased him, and she was glad of it, for now the toad could not possibly reach her, and the country through which she sailed was beautiful, and the sun shone upon the water, till it glittered like liquid gold.
3	In the evening they came to a large forest, and they were so weary with sorrow and hunger and the long walk, that they lay down in a hollow tree and fell asleep.
2	Then they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and gave him plenty to eat and drink, for he was very hungry; and then they fetched new clothes for him, for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his journey.
2	"With the greatest pleasure," said the Princess.
2	She said this merrily, for she was the best of the hens, and, moreover, as had been said, very respectable.
4	When the princesses saw him they fainted.
0	The fifth, "Who has been handling my fork?"
2	Now what I really--REALLY should like-- would be a little dish of honey!"
2	How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other!
2	And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and said, "This is the right bride."
1	The kernel, however, was so large that she could not swallow it, and it remained sticking in her throat, so that she was alarmed lest she should be choked.
1	And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there was a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but the eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy.
3	The boy went down, and there sat Clever Elsie and the girl both weeping together.
1	The warmth revived the poor little creature; but when the children wanted to play with him, the duckling thought they would do him some harm; so he started up in terror, fluttered into the milk-pan, and splashed the milk about the room.
1	How they terrified the poor duckling!
2	They cut the Apple of Life in two and ate it together; and then her heart became full of love for him, and they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age.
2	"Oh that IS lovely!" said Lucie.
3	But these doubts were no support to her, nothing on which she could rest, and she sunk into the fathomless depths of despair.
2	From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found outside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: "Come, cat, we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we shall enjoy that."
2	The huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, "If all this does happen, it will be a fine thing for me."
2	And all came to pass as she had said; Heinel bore all, and spoke not a word; and the third night the princess came, and fell on his neck and kissed him.
1	"Now you will see the gold-jacket fly," said the old man, letting the sparrow go, which flew away in deadly fear, with the sun shining upon her.
1	The second did not want to go in at all, but was forced.
2	This was very amusing, and Ida could not help laughing.
0	Go out of my sight.
1	Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: "Thank heaven, you are back again!
1	They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves.
2	The good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them from that time forward, as long as they lived.
2	The two played together, and loved each other with all their hearts, and the old cook went out hunting like a nobleman.
1	Jemima became much alarmed.
4	"Alas!" said the mouse, "now I see what has happened, now it comes to light!
1	He might certainly have found a good bed on the soft moss, but the fear of wild beasts let him have no rest there, and at last he was forced to make up his mind to spend the night in a tree.
2	They had a large family, and they were very improvident and cheerful.
3	Hunger and thirst overpowered the child, and he became quite faint and ill.
3	The man"s heart was heavy, and he thought: "It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your children."
0	How many arts do you understand?"
2	"Ah, yes, with all my heart," she answered, for she was glad to get away from the mother and sister.
2	Great was old Mr. Bouncer's relief and Flopsy's joy when Peter and Benjamin arrived in triumph with the young family.
0	And the rest came running to him, and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his bed.
2	So they were married, and lived together very happily till they died.
2	But the king said, "You are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each other."
2	The diamonds glittered so on all sides that they were delighted with the sight and picked up the finest.
2	Alexander went into squeals of laughter.
2	At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about his son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than before.
0	When she felt the vegetables she became very very angry.
2	Once, but long years had intervened since then, guitars and Eolian harps had been hung on his boughs by merry travellers; now they seemed to hang there again, and he could hear their marvellous tones.
3	"Because," said the dog, "I am very very hungry, and have nothing to eat."
0	"The world is no good!" he said.
2	Whenever the sun shone, we felt his warm rays, and the little birds would relate stories to us as they sung.
2	"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse!
2	After this the robbers never dared to go back to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters that they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at this very day.
3	"But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same," said the man.
2	The princess sprang up, threw her arms round his neck, embraced and kissed him repeatedly, and took her stomacher, which was made of pure gold, and hung it round his neck.
4	"What my commands are?" replied the soldier, quite astonished.
1	But he would not, and said that it would be a very hazardous thing; for if the least ray of the torch-light should fall upon him his enchantment would become still worse, for he should be changed into a dove, and be forced to wander about the world for seven long years.
0	Now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and scolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her revenge.
4	The counsellor stared with astonishment as he beheld a most strange procession pass before him.
3	"Now," thought she to herself, "no aid of man can be of use to me."
2	I am happier than ever."
0	The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and the third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in the mornings and refused to get up.
1	The horse-hair was drawn tightly round her leg- as tightly as if the latter were to be cut off; she was in great pain and terror.
2	What the little fish had foretold soon came to pass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king could not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great feast and make merry, and show the child to all the land.
2	Those were happy days, and the bottle would sing when rubbed with a cork, and it was called a great lark," "Peter Jensen's lark."
2	"I have had plenty of meat," answered he, "but I should like to have a piece of bread to eat after it."
2	"These little wights have made us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good turn if we can.
0	"What do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts?" said the rat, chattering his teeth.
2	For very joy, it felt ready to jump out of people's hands, and scarcely noticed that its cork had been drawn, and its contents emptied out, till it found itself carried to a cellar, to be left there and forgotten.
2	I cannot be happier than I am now."
4	Pigling Bland was shocked, there was little hope of sleeping in Market Town, and tomorrow was the hiring fair; it was deplorable to think how much time had been wasted by the frivolity of Alexander.
3	So the father gave him his blessing, and with great sorrow took leave of him.
3	Aunt Pettitoes wiped her eyes with a large pocket handkerchief, then she wiped Pigling Bland's nose and shed tears; then she wiped Alexander's nose and shed tears; then she passed the handkerchief to Spot.
3	"I cannot endure it," said the tin soldier, who stood on a shelf, "it is so lonely and dull here.
4	A hungry wolf sprang out, and swallowed up the whole stomach, with Tom in it, at one gulp, and ran away.
3	Thus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn; but she took heart and said, "As far as the wind blows, and so long as the cock crows, I will journey on, till I find him once again."
0	"It is stupid nonsense to allow yourself to shoot out in this way; we are not here to support you."
2	So he got nothing by it but vexation, trouble, abuse, and the loss of his horse; but the poor people lived happily, quietly, and piously until their happy death.
0	But I do not understand chattering and boasting; on the contrary, I despise it."
0	But the goblin felt very angry that any man should venture to say such things to a huckster who was a householder and sold the best butter.
3	I saw my poor dead father, and cried till I fell asleep.
2	As soon as he spied Tiny, he was delighted; and then she told him how unwilling she felt to marry the ugly mole, and to live always beneath the earth, and never to see the bright sun any more.
0	The old king was still very angry with his youngest son, and thought that he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called his court together, and asked what should be done, and all agreed that he ought to be put to death.
2	He could not utter a word; he could only seize her hand and hold it fast in his own, but he felt too happy and glad to open his lips.
0	He made his way up the hill; his temper was not improved by noticing unmistakable marks of badger.
4	"A difference!" cried the sunbeam, as he kissed the blooming apple-branch, and then kissed the yellow dandelion out in the fields.
2	So she took him by the wrist, and he laughed till he nearly choked; and when she came to the fourth finger, there was a gold ring on it, as if it knew there was to be a betrothal.
4	I never heard the name in my life, I"ll wager anything it is not in the calendar!"
0	The sight of this made the tailor so angry that he laid hold of the golden footstool, and threw it down to earth through heaven, at the old thief.
0	All at once the wax doll which rode on the carnival rod seemed to grow larger and taller, and it turned round and said to the paper flowers, "How can you put such things in a child's head? they are all foolish fancies;" and then the doll was exactly like the lawyer with the broad brimmed hat, and looked as yellow and as cross as he did; but the paper dolls struck him on his thin legs, and he shrunk up again and became quite a little wax doll.
2	You may have thousands of my days, but I have thousands of moments in which I can be merry and happy.
0	"Yes, indeed," she replied, "no such a thing as a respectable meat soup- their cookery is miserable stuff."
3	And then they kissed each other, and the girl wept, and gave him a rose; but before she did so, she pressed a kiss upon it so fervently that the flower opened.
2	But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled upon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also awoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder.
1	Fear came upon her as if a cold, clammy hand had been laid upon her heart, so that she almost fainted.
2	When the bear heard the music, he could not help beginning to dance, and when he had danced a while, the thing pleased him so well that he said to the little tailor, "Hark you, is the fiddle heavy?"
1	The king thought something had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to him, wanted to help him, and drew his glove off.
4	"This is passing extraordinary!" said the Tailor of Gloucester, and turned over another tea-cup, which was upside down.
4	"It's a drop of puddle water!" said Kribble-Krabble.
2	Talk of a pig, indeed!
3	Gretel began to cry and said: "How are we to get out of the forest now?"
2	"Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!" said Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the wheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to its leg.
2	There came presently across the fields a whole group of children, the youngest of whom was so small that it had to be carried by the others; and when he was seated on the grass, among the yellow flowers, he laughed aloud with joy, kicked out his little legs, rolled about, plucked the yellow flowers, and kissed them in childlike innocence.
2	She and the boy kissed each other, and then they were of the same age and felt the same joys.
2	"Yes, terribly lonely," cried the tin soldier; "still it is delightful not to be forgotten."
3	She could not bear to think of living with the old toad, and having her ugly son for a husband.
3	Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly which had brought her so low.
2	Then the prince took care to throw away the sleeping draught; and when Lily came and began again to tell him what woes had befallen her, and how faithful and true to him she had been, he knew his beloved wife"s voice, and sprang up, and said, "You have awakened me as from a dream, for the strange princess had thrown a spell around me, so that I had altogether forgotten you; but Heaven hath sent you to me in a lucky hour."
3	He wept at the thought, and then he played with the little, lively dog, and kissed it, while the old woman looked kindly at him to encourage him.
3	I'm in sad trouble, Cousin Ribby," said Tabitha, shedding tears.
1	The king, however, would not give his consent, and said: "It is not safe in there; I fear it would fare with you no better than with the others, and you would never come out again."
2	I will sit on a bough outside your window, in the evening, and sing to you, so that you may be happy, and have thoughts full of joy.
4	"Upon my word!" cried the miller, and went thither, and found the roast meat.
2	One stanza pleased him exceedingly-
0	But the lawyer did not like such jokes, and he would say as he had just said, "How can anyone put such nonsense into a child's head! what absurd fancies there are!"
0	The King, however, had a wicked mother who was dissatisfied with this marriage and spoke ill of the young Queen.
2	As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.
2	Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them, and drove the spit merrily round.
0	And Mr. McGregor was very angry too.
3	By degrees, however, his sorrow grew less, and although at times he still grieved over his loss, he was able to go about as usual, and later on he married again.
2	Her joy was still more increased when her brother, who had killed the magician in the form of the bull, came out of the forest towards them in his human form, and on the self-same day the maiden, in accordance with her promise, gave her hand at the altar to the lucky tailor.
2	Ah! now I know what it is to shudder!"
2	Then it joined in the song of the angels, who surrounded the throne, some near, and others in a distant circle, but all equally happy.
2	Thus sounded the old Christmas carol, and every one on board the ship felt his thoughts elevated, through the song and the prayer, even as the old tree had felt lifted up in its last, its beautiful dream on that Christmas morn.
0	"Who are you, and what do you want?" asked the man in a grumbling voice.
0	The young storks were very angry, and grew worse as they grew older; so at last their mother was obliged to promise that they should be revenged, but not until the day of their departure.
2	She smiled once more, and then people said she was dead.
1	The maiden was frightened when she saw, not her little roe, but a man come in who wore a golden crown upon his head.
4	"Ah," she exclaimed, "here is a gilt top."
3	During that time the flower has stood in the window, withered and forgotten, till at length cast out among the sweepings into the street, on the day of the lodgers' removal.
1	One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be alone; and Jorindel said, "We must take care that we don"t go too near to the fairy"s castle."
2	How merry we shall be!
2	Then the old one bleated, and went on her way with an easy mind.
2	Whilst the cook was above stairs, she got the golden necklace and dropped it into the soup; then it was brought to the king, who ate it, and it pleased him as well as before; so he sent for the cook, who was again forced to tell him that Cat-skin had cooked it.
2	And they were very glad to see her, and took care not to wake her; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs in turn, till the night was gone.
0	My repugnance to his magic arts was, however, so great, that I vouchsafed him no answer.
3	Then Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts came and wept with him over poor Partlet.
3	If I did not take pity on you and save you, you would be lost."
1	He had nodded, and pointed to the sack, and seemed doubled up with laughing.--"Come away, Peter; he will be cooking them; come quicker!" said Benjamin Bunny.
0	She pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house.
4	As if these things were of any consequence!
2	How happy my mother will be!
1	Then the queen was very much frightened; for she knew that the glass always spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed her.
2	Then Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought that now she should go to the ball.
0	Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that Snowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite another dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned comb.
0	Then the father fell into a rage and said: "Oh, you lost man, you have spent the precious time and learnt nothing; are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes?
2	"That will be delightful," she said, and clapped her little hands for joy.
0	Take the good-for-nothing fellow out of our house."
0	But Marguerite did not answer him; she was offended that he should call her a woman when she was only a girl; and there is a great difference.
1	"Oh, Mother, Mother!" said Mittens--
3	"Yes, it is infested with rats," said Tabitha tearfully.
2	So on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met with some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all.
2	The dog liked this plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed.
1	And in sight of the bridge!" said poor Pigling, nearly crying.
4	You a true friend!
4	"Good heavens!" said the girl, "no strawberries grow in winter!
3	Had I still my old eye, which was broken off, I believe I should weep; but no, I would not do that, it is not genteel to cry."
3	She wept over it, kissed it, and prayed for it as only a mother can pray in that hour of her anguish."
1	As these thoughts passed through her mind, fear gave speed to her feet, so that she walked faster and faster.
2	Could he ever forget those beautiful, happy birds; and when at last they were out of his sight, he dived under the water, and rose again almost beside himself with excitement.
4	"That would be a fine thing!" cried the miller, and looked there, and found the cakes.
1	Then she dressed herself up as a peasant"s wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs" cottage, and knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and said, "I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not."
2	"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse!
2	Then she said: "Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is eaten you will have some peace, why should God"s good gifts be spoilt?"
1	"No," said Snowdrop, "I dare not take it."
2	"Ah," sighed the woman heavily, "if I had but a child, as red as blood and as white as snow," and as she spoke the words, her heart grew light within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and she returned to the house feeling glad and comforted.
0	Then Mr. Tod rushed upon Tommy Brock, and Tommy Brock grappled with Mr. Tod amongst the broken crockery, and there was a terrific battle all over the kitchen.
2	He seized her hand, he embraced her, and the mother wept.
3	The flower could not, as on the previous evening, fold up its petals and sleep; it dropped sorrowfully.
2	His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great delight, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear son again.
1	Peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.
3	The poor old tailor was very ill with a fever, tossing and turning in his four-post bed; and still in his dreams he mumbled: "No more twist! no more twist!"
1	But the youngest said, "I don"t know how it is, while you are so happy I feel very uneasy; I am sure some mischance will befall us."
3	And Molly and Anthony both wept, but these tears all flowed together into one tear which had the rosy shimmer of joy.
2	It laughed and chuckled when it heard Timmy's story.
3	Very little was said about the matter to Ib, and he did not refer to it; his mother, however, noticed that he had grown very silent and pensive.
2	Then there was great rejoicing, and the painter caressed the boy, and gave him a number of pictures.
2	And the king then gave to each half a kingdom, as he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and took good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the young lady, than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have her again.
3	I have tooth- ache," said Pigling much dismayed.
3	She thought God could not take her darling little one from her; and when it did happen notwithstanding her hopes and her belief, and there could be no more doubt on the subject, she said in her feverish agony, "God does not know it.
1	Then the servant was greatly frightened, and said, "It may perhaps be only a cat or a dog."
2	"How happy am I!" cried he; "nobody was ever so lucky as I."
2	Then the children went home together, and were heartily delighted, and if they have not died, they are living still.
0	Then he was very angry, and went without his supper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into his cheek: at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have run out of the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell down on his head, and killed him on the spot.
3	"How lonely it is, wife," said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, "for you and me to sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse us while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!"
3	This grieved him very much, for Lily was his dearest child; and as he was journeying home, thinking what he should bring her, he came to a fine castle; and around the castle was a garden, in one half of which it seemed to be summer-time and in the other half winter.
1	But whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a horse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their prisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a cord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away.
2	Hans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his elbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one minute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,
3	"What you say is very true," said the wife, sighing, and turning round her wheel; "how happy should I be if I had but one child!
0	She carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the boy"s father, "Your boy," cried she, "has been the cause of a great misfortune!
1	Pigling Bland became frightened and cried "Wee, wee, wee!
0	I will see you no more."
0	"Ha! what are you doing?" cried the devil angrily.
3	Then said the mother likewise: "What a clever Elsie we have!" and sat down and wept with them.
0	Then the mannikin grew very angry and said he was to do it, but the huntsman would not, and took my dear mannikin, and gave him a thorough beating.
3	Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife.
2	It was saying, 'You are so pretty, I like you very much.'
4	"I thought you had eaten them?" said Pigling, waking suddenly.
1	It was dreadful to hear all that, for the preacher spoke from his heart, and all the people in the church were terrified.
0	"Did not you ask it for anything?" said the wife, "we live very wretchedly here, in this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug little cottage."
3	"If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together."
2	"Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN?" said the lady slyly.
0	I"ll give it you well for your insolence!" and upon that she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily.
2	But when he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it, so he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth.
2	Then Mother Holle said, "I am pleased that you should want to go back to your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully, I will take you home myself."
1	When they came near the wood at the top of Bull Banks, they went cautiously.
3	"Ah!" said the man, dolefully, "my wife wants to live in a stone castle."
3	Peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself.
2	And the rain fell upon the burdock-leaves, to play the drum for them, and the sun shone to paint colors on the burdock forest for them, and they were very happy; the whole family were entirely and perfectly happy.
2	Then he made the best of his way off, while the nurse laughed and the baby crowed; and all the court jeered at him for having had so much trouble for nothing, and said, "We wish you a very good morning, and a merry feast, Mr RUMPLESTILTSKIN!"
4	They had very small eyes and looked surprised.
2	"After all," thought he, "that chap is pretty well taken in.
4	So he said, "Yes," and forgot the fox"s counsel, and sat down on the side of the river; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him down the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went home to the king their master, and said.
0	"He's gone to the very extreme," said mamma-in-law; "he has gone from the most beautiful to the ugliest, and he has forgotten his first wife.
